[AMaze](/software#amaze) is now live on
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/amaze-benchmarker)!

Currently, this is a pre-release candidate but the API should remain pretty 
stable.
A few improvements can be made with respect to the documentation depending 
on user needs.
Download it now and give some feedback!
