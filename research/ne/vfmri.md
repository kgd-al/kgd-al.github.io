Artificial Neural Networks take a lot of inspiration from biology although with much abstraction.
Still even with such abstractions, it is not a trivial thing to understand exactly how anything but the simplest of perceptron operates.
This makes ANNs, amongst others, a "black box" model because all we know is what comes in and what comes out with next to no knowledge about the internals.

While in recent decades there has been an increasing trend towards explainable AI (XAI), ANNs have been placed on the far end of desirable models because of that opacity.
Alternatives encoding such as Genetic Programming{% cite Miller2000 Poli2008 Miller2011 %} may also produce convoluted solutions but their end results is, at least, *potentially* intelligible by a human.
At the same time, ANNs are extremely powerful as illustrated by, relatively, recent results on playing games from Atari{% cite Mnih2013 %} or competitive e-sports{% cite OpenAI2019 %} or extensive text generation{% cite OpenAI2023 %}.

While not the first attempt at making ANNs more understandable{% cite someone %} I argue here that the use of *Virtual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging* (VfMRI), has tangible benefits:
- It operates on irregular, emergent topologies
