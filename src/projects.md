## Miscellaneous projects

### Splinoids port to python

The [Splinoids](/software#splinoids) have an incredibly complex morphological space with 3 human-level senses.
However, their current implementation in C++ drastically limits their interoperability with other tools.
Either by creating Python bindings or by completely porting the code, the Pynoids/sPlYnoids/Spynoids (pun is a work in progress) would be able to colonize a more favorable ecosystem.
