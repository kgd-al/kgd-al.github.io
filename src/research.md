My initial experimentations were focused on bio-inspired evolution of virtuals plants of various scales: from mitosis-based developmental models of a single entity to complex colonies in dynamical environments.
Following the obtention of my PhD, I broadened the scope of my research to include Artificial Neural Networks evolved through a scalable method with indirect encoding.
These were, first, applied to 2D robots with morphological components and, later on, to modular 3D robots.
