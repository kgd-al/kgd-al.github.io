[AMaze](/software#amaze) is a pure Python library for sighted learning agents.
It combines low computational costs with a high capacity for customization to generate challenging, yet quickly computed, tasks.
Its main use is as a benchmark generator to try out different implementation of algorithms from Reinforcement Learning to NeuroEvolution.

While the implementation is mostly done with a soon-to-be mature API, the characteristics and most favorable uses of the library are not yet fully explored.
A few projects are currently underway to make progress in that direction:
* Impact of human agent in Interactive Reinforcement Learning
* CNNs for maze-navigating agents

In addition, open projects remain:
* Continuous control in maze-navigating agents
* Integration with existing libraries:
  - [x] Stable baselines 3
  - [ ] [ABrain](/software#abrain)
  - [ ] Anything else?

Feel free to contact me to participate.
