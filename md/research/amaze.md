AMaze is a benchmark maker library meant to provide a fast prototyping platform. 
In the midst of my combining NeuroEvolution with Reinforcement Learning on an Evolutionary Robotics platform, the cost of using the latter became obviously hindering.
From this stemmed the core concepts of the library: lightweight computations, controllable environmental complexity and easy human interaction.

The [documentation](https://amaze.readthedocs.io/) does a good job at producing an overview of the library.
This page only distillates results from publications and provides a hub for the various projects it is involved in.

## List of projects

* [apets](/md/projects/apets.html), as a lightweight platform to test the combination of NeuroEvolution and Reinforcement Learning on a visual task with sparse rewards
* main [project](/md/projects/amaze.html) page, listing current or planned work
