abstract = {Many researchers have argued that humanity will create artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the next twenty to one hundred years. It has been suggested that AGI may inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale ('catastrophic risk'). After summarizing the arguments for why AGI may pose such a risk, we review the fields proposed responses to AGI risk. We consider societal proposals, proposals for external constraints on AGI behaviors and proposals for creating AGIs that are safe due to their internal design.},

@article{Langton1989,
abstract = {"Art" + "Life" = Artificial Life: Life made by Man rather than by Nature. Our technological capabilities have brought us to the point where we are on the verge of creating "living" artifacts. The field of Artificial Life is devoted to studying the scientific, technological, artistic, philosophical, and social implications of such an accomplishment. 1 THE BIOLOGY OF POSSIBLE LIFE Biology is the scientific study of life - in principle anyway. In practice, biology is the scientific study of life on Earth based on carbon-chain chemistry. There is nothing in its charter that restricts biology to carbon-based life; it is simply that this is the only kind of life that has been available to study. Thus, theoretical biology has long faced the fundamental obstacle that it is impossible to derive general principles from single examples. Without other examples, it is difficult to distinguish essential properties of life-properties that would be shared by any living system - from properties that may be incidental to life in principle, but which happen to be universal to life on Earth due solely to a combination of local historical accident and common genetic descent. In order to derive general theories about life, we need an ensemble of instances to generalize over. Since it is quite unlikely that alien life forms will present themselves to us for study in the near future, our only option is to try to create alternative life-forms ourselves - Artificial Life - literally "life made by Man rather than by Nature".},

@article{Pianca2022a,
abstract = {Currently, the autonomy of artificial systems, robotic systems in particular, is certainly one of the most debated issues, both from the perspective of technological development and its social impact and ethical repercussions. While theoretical considerations often focus on scenarios far beyond what can be concretely hypothesized from the current state of the art, the term autonomy is still used in a vague or too general way. This reduces the possibilities of a punctual analysis of such an important issue, thus leading to often polarized positions (naive optimism or unfounded defeatism). The intent of this paper is to clarify what is meant by artificial autonomy, and what are the prerequisites that can allow the attribution of this characteristic to a robotic system. Starting from some concrete examples, we will try to indicate a way towards artificial autonomy that can hold together the advantages of developing adaptive and versatile systems with the management of the inevitable problems that this technology poses both from the viewpoint of safety and ethics. Our proposal is that a real artificial autonomy, especially if expressed in the social context, can only be achieved through interdependence with other social actors (human and otherwise), through continuous exchanges and interactions which, while allowing robots to explore the environment, guarantee the emergence of shared practices, behaviors, and ethical principles, which otherwise could not be imposed with a top-down approach, if not at the price of giving up the same artificial autonomy.},

@article{Risi2013,
abstract = {The ambulatory capabilities of legged robots offer the potential for access to dangerous and uneven terrain without a risk to human life. However, while machine learning has proven effective at training such robots to walk, a significant limitation of such approaches is that controllers trained for a specific robot are likely to fail when transferred to a robot with a slightly different morphology. This paper confronts this challenge with a novel strategy: Instead of training a controller for a particular quadruped morphology, it evolves a special function (through a method called HyperNEAT) that takes morphology as input and outputs an entire neural network controller fitted to the specific morphology. Once such a relationship is learned the output controllers are able to work on a diversity of different morphologies. Highlighting the unique potential of such an approach, in this paper a neural controller evolved for three different robot morphologies, which differ in the length of their legs, can interpolate to never-seen intermediate morphologies without any further training. Thus this work suggests a new research path towards learning controllers for whole ranges of morphologies: Instead of learning controllers themselves, it is possible to learn the relationship between morphology and control.},

abstract = {It is often suggested that traditional models of artificial evolution, based on explicit, human-defined fitness functions, are fundamentally more restricted and less creative than natural evolution, in which no such constraint exists. After a discussion and refinement of this statement, we suggest a classification of evolutionary systems according to their evolutionary ldquocreativityrdquo. We describe an environment, called Evosphere, in which a population of 3D creatures interact, fight with each other, and evolve freely on the surface of a ldquomicroplanetrdquo. We demonstrate the onset of natural selection and adaptive evolution within this virtual world, both by visual inspection and statistical analysis. We show that the introduction of reproductively isolated species enriches the dynamics of the system, leading to simple evolutionary feedbacks among species.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose ELF, an Extensive, Lightweight and Flexible platform for fundamental reinforcement learning research. Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-per-second (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like Arcade Learning Environment. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than {\$}70\backslash{\%}{\$} of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies.

@article{Risi2012,
abstract = {Intelligence in nature is the product of living brains, which are themselves the product of natural evolution. Although researchers in the field of neuroevolution (NE) attempt to recapitulate this process, artificial neural networks (ANNs) so far evolved through NE algorithms do not match the distinctive capabilities of biological brains. The recently introduced hypercube-based neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (HyperNEAT) approach narrowed this gap by demonstrating that the pattern of weights across the connectivity of an ANN can be generated as a function of its geometry, thereby allowing large ANNs to be evolved for high-dimensional problems. Yet the positions and number of the neurons connected through this approach must be decided a priori by the user and, unlike in living brains, cannot change during evolution. Evolvable-substrate HyperNEAT (ES-HyperNEAT), introduced in this article, addresses this limitation by automatically deducing the node geometry from implicit information in the pattern of weights encoded by HyperNEAT, thereby avoiding the need to evolve explicit placement. This approach not only can evolve the location of every neuron in the network, but also can represent regions of varying density, which means resolution can increase holistically over evolution. ES-HyperNEAT is demonstrated through multi-task, maze navigation, and modular retina domains, revealing that the ANNs generated by this new approach assume natural properties such as neural topography and geometric regularity. Also importantly, ES-HyperNEAT's compact indirect encoding can be seeded to begin with a bias toward a desired class of ANN topographies, which facilitates the evolutionary search. The main conclusion is that ES-HyperNEAT significantly expands the scope of neural structures that evolution can discover. {\textcopyright}2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Little AI is a pedagogical game aimed at presenting the founding concepts of constructivist learning and developmental Artificial Intelligence. It primarily targets students in computer science and cognitive science but it can also interest the general public curious about these topics. It requires no particular scientific background; even children can find it entertaining. Professors can use it as a pedagogical resource in class or in online courses. The player presses buttons to control a simulated “baby robot”. The player cannot see the robot and its environment, and initially ignores the effects of the commands. The only information received by the player is feedback from the player's commands. The player must learn, at the same time, the functioning of the robot's body and the structure of the environment from patterns in the stream of commands and feedback. We argue that this situation is analogous to how infants engage in early-stage developmental learning (e.g., Piaget (1937), [1]).},

abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) refers to the practice of generating game content, such as levels, quests or characters, algorithmically. Motivated by the need to make games replayable, as well as to reduce authoring burden and enable particular aesthetics, many PCG methods have been devised. At the same time that researchers are adapting methods from machine learning (ML) to PCG problems, the ML community has become more interested in PCG-inspired methods. One reason for this development is that ML algorithms often only work for a particular version of a particular task with particular initial parameters. In response, researchers have begun exploring randomization of problem parameters to counteract such overfitting and to allow trained policies to more easily transfer from one environment to another, such as from a simulated robot to a robot in the real world. Here we review existing work on PCG, its overlap with current efforts in ML, and promising new research directions such as procedurally generated learning environments. Although originating in games, we believe PCG algorithms are critical to creating more general machine intelligence.},

abstract = {The field of evolved virtual creatures has been suspiciously stagnant in terms of complexification of evolved agents since its inception over two decades ago. Many researchers have proposed algorithmic improvements, but none have taken hold and greatly propelled the scalability of early works. This paper suggests a more fundamental problem with co-evolving both the morphology and control of virtual creatures simultaneously - one cemented in the theory of embodied cognition. We reproduce and explore in greater detail a previous finding in the literature: premature convergence of the mor-phology (compared to the convergence point of optimizing controllers), and discuss how this finding fits as a symptom of the proposed problem. We hope that this improved under-standing of the fundamental problem domain will open the door for further scalability of evolved agents, and note that early findings from our future work point in that direction.},

abstract = {How can we build agents that keep learning from experience, quickly and efficiently, after their initial training? Here we take inspiration from the main mechanism of learning in biological brains: Synaptic plasticity, carefully tuned by evolution to produce efficient lifelong learning. We show that plasticity, just like connection weights, can be optimized by gradient descent in large (millions of parameters) recurrent networks with Heb- bian plastic connections. First, recurrent plastic networks with more than two million parameters can be trained to memorize and reconstruct sets of novel, high-dimensional (1,000+ pixels) natural images not seen during training. Crucially, traditional non-plastic recurrent networks fail to solve this task. Furthermore, trained plastic networks can also solve generic meta-learning tasks such as the Omniglot task, with competitive results and little parameter overhead. Finally, in reinforcement learning settings, plastic networks outperform a non-plastic equivalent in a maze exploration task. We conclude that differentiable plasticity may provide a powerful novel approach to the learning-to-learn problem.},

In nature, swarms possess remarkable properties, which allow many organisms, from swarming bacteria to ants and flocking birds, to form higher-order structures that enhance their behavior as a group. Swarm simulations highlight three important factors to create novelty and diversity: (a) communication generates combinatorial cooperative dynamics, (b) concurrency allows for separation of time scales, and (c) complexity and size increases push the system towards transitions in innovation. We illustrate these three components in a model computing the continuous evolution of a swarm of agents. The results, divided into three distinct applications, show how emergent structures are capable of filtering information through the bottleneck of their memory, to produce meaningful novelty and diversity within their simulated environment.},

abstract = {The ESP method for evolving virtual creatures (Lessin et al., 2013) consisted of an encapsulation mechanism to preserve learned skills, a human-designed syllabus to build higherlevel skills by combining lower-level skills systematically, and a pandemonium mechanism to resolve conflicts between encapsulated skills in a single creature's brain. Previous work with ESP showed that it is possible to evolve much more complex behavior than before, even when fundamental morphology (i.e., skeletal segments and joints) was evolved only for the first skill. This paper introduces a more general form of ESP in which full morphological development can continue beyond the first skill, allowing creatures to adapt their morphology to multiple tasks. This extension increases the variety and quality of evolved creature results significantly, while maintaining the original ESP system's ability to incrementally develop complex behaviors from a sequence of simpler learning tasks. In the future, this method should make it possible to build EVCs with complex and believable behavior.},

The proposed control system is composed of a leg motion controller and a gait pattern controller within a hierarchical architecture. The leg controller drives actuators at the joints of the legs using a high-gain local feedback control. It receives the command signal from the gait pattern controller. The gait pattern controller, on the other hand, involves nonlinear oscillators. These oscillators interact with each other through signals from the touch sensors located at the tips of the legs. Various gait patterns emerge through the mutual entrainment of these oscillators. As a result, the system walks stably in a wide velocity range by changing its gait patterns and limiting the increase in energy consumption of the actuators. The performance of the proposed control system is verified by numerical simulations.},

We conclude that at least some of the intricate properties of language evolution need not depend on complex evolved linguistic capabilities, but can emerge from simple social exchanges between perceptually-enabled agents playing communication games.},

Yet training generalist agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks remains an outstanding challenge. Recent advances in unsupervised RL have shown that pre-training RL agents with self-supervised intrinsic rewards can result in efficient adaptation. However, these algorithms have been hard to compare and develop due to the lack of a unified benchmark. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB). URLB consists of two phases: reward-free pre-training and downstream task adaptation with extrinsic rewards. Building on the DeepMind Control Suite, we provide twelve continuous control tasks from three domains for evaluation and open-source code for eight leading unsupervised RL methods. We find that the implemented baselines make progress but are not able to solve URLB and propose directions for future research.},

abstract = {Standard methods for simultaneously inducing the structure and weights of recurrent neural networks limit every task to an assumed class of architectures. Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods. {\textcopyright} 1994 IEEE},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

abstract = {Most of the work of John Horton Conway , a mathematician at Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge , has been in pure mathematics. For instance, in 1967 he discovered a new group--some call it "Conway's constellation"--that includes all but two of the then known sporadic groups. (They are called "sporadic" because they fail to fit any classification scheme.) Is is a breakthrough that has had exciting repercussions in both group theory and number theory. It ties in closely with an earlier discovery by John Conway of an extremely dense packing of unit spheres in a space of 24 dimensions where each sphere touches 196,560 others. As Conway has remarked, "There is a lot of room up there."},

abstract = {Neural networks and genetic algorithms are two relatively young research areas that were subject to a steadily growing interest during the past years. Both models are inspired by nature, but whereas neural networks are concerned with learning of an individual (phenotypic learning), evolutionary algorithms deal with a population's adaptation to a changing environment (genotypic learning). This paper focuses on the intersection of neural networks and evolutionary computation, namely on how evolutionary algorithms can be used to assist neural network design and training. The purpose of the paper is to set forth the general considerations that have to be made when designing an algorithm in this area and to give an overview on how researchers addressed these issues in the past.},

abstract = {We created a simple evolutionary system, sexyloop, on a deterministic ten-state five-neighbour cellular automaton (CA) where self-reproducing loops have the capability of sex. With this ability, the loops are capable of transferring genetic material into other loops. This work was based on Sayama's evoloop which was transformed by adding a new state and new rules. The evoloop model showed an emergent evolutionary process only due to an adaptation of the loops to interaction in the environment; and after a certain time, all the individuals capable of self-reproduction belonged to the smallest species 4 which reproduced the fastest. We created two different models of self-reproducing loops with sex, sexyloop M1 and M2, in order to study the possibility of sex in self-reproducing automata and to assess the impact of sex on the evolutionary process via comparing between the evoloop and the sexyloop variants. In the sexyloop M1 and M2, the diversity of the whole population was different from that found in the evoloop and the evolutionary process was quite different too. The sexyloops also created smaller and bigger species than the evoloops, and exhibited greater diversity and faster evolution than their non-sexual counterparts. The most interesting model was the sexyloop M2 whose evolutionary dynamics had a very different longterm behaviour than the evoloop and sexyloop M1. The most surprising and intriguing phenomenon in the sexyloop M2 was that the evolutionary process was selecting quickly a bigger species than in the evoloop and sexyloop M1: the species 5. In fact, the individuals from this species needed more time to reproduce than those from the species 4. So it appears that in the sexyloop M2, the fittest individual was not one that could reproduce the fastest but surely one that reproduced fast and which was more adapted to propagate in an environment where sex with individuals of the same and other types could occur. These results give the first examples in ce- llular automata of evolution in a population of self-replicators where sex plays an important role},

Among the most common benchmarks in RL, it is customary to use the same environments for both training and testing. This practice offers relatively little insight into an agent's ability to generalize. We address this issue by using procedurally generated environments to construct distinct training and test sets. Most notably, we introduce a new environment called CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization in RL. Using CoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training sets. We then show that deeper convolutional architectures improve generalization, as do methods traditionally found in supervised learning, including L2 regularization, dropout, data augmentation and batch normalization.},

We show that artificial neural networks trained with generic deep-learning methods to play a color-discrimination game develop color-naming systems whose distribution on the accuracy/complexity plane is strikingly similar to that of human languages. We proceed to show that efficiency and narrow complexity crucially depend on the discrete nature of communication, acting as an information bottleneck on the emergent code. This suggests that efficient categorization of colors (and possibly other semantic domains) in natural languages does not depend on specific biological constraints of humans, but it is instead a general property of discrete communication systems.},

abstract = {The autonomous learning of different objects in images, with a continual and unsupervised context, relies on detecting unknown objects and recognizing known ones based on the learned visual representation. Novelty detection is challenging because of the internal representation drifts of known objects not been seen for a long time. Most existing approaches either perform offline unsupervised learning on a large dataset, or continual supervised learning. Nevertheless, very few existing approaches propose unsupervised continual learning for object recognition. In this paper, we propose a new neural network-based approach for continually learning representations of objects from image sequences, that is able to autonomously detect novel objects and to recognize previously learned ones during training. It is based on a statistical test, performed on internal representations, adapted to counterbalance the concept drift, without storing any image. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state of the art on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. In particular, our approach avoids to over-segment the distribution of clusters, which artificially increases traditional indicators such as clustering accuracy.},

Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strate- gies and counter-strategies emerge.},

abstract = {The field of evolutionary computation is inspired by the achievements of natural evolution, in which there is no final objective. Yet the pursuit of objectives is ubiquitous in simulated evolution. A significant problem is that objective approaches assume that intermediate stepping stones will increasingly resemble the final objective when in fact they often do not. The consequence is that while solutions may exist, searching for such objectives may not discover them. This paper highlights the importance of leveraging human insight during search as an alternative to articulating explicit objectives. In particular, a new approach called novelty-assisted interactive evolutionary computation (NA-IEC) combines human intuition with novelty search for the first time to facilitate the serendipitous discovery of agent behaviors. In this approach, the human user directs evolution by selecting what is interesting from the on-screen population of behaviors. However, unlike in typical IEC, the user can now request that the next generation be filled with novel descendants. The experimental results demonstrate that combining human insight with novelty search finds solutions significantly faster and at lower genomic complexities than fully-automated processes, including pure novelty search, suggesting an important role for human users in the search for solutions.},

abstract = {Collective decision-making systems rely on many agents to gather, process and exchange information to arrive at a group decision. Critical to group success is the transfer of information among agents and between agents and their environment. Without information transfer, no consensus can be achieved. Yet, the role of individual rules in determining information transfer at the group level is poorly understood. With the aim to shed a light on how the decision mechanism of individuals affects information transfer in collectives, we analyze the information landscape of two decision-making strategies: one based on the majority rule and one based on the voter model. For each strategy, we consider a binary site-selection scenario and use transfer entropy to measure the flow of information in a spatial, multi-agent system. We find that information transferred among agents is dependent on the decision mechanism, increases with the time necessary to make a collective decision, and is loosely modulated by the uncertainty of the final outcome. This is the first study that compares collective decision making mechanisms through the lens of information dynamics. Although this approach is limited to simulated agents, similar approaches could in principle be used to study collective decisions in biological systems.},

abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

abstract = {A theory is proposed for the development of filamentous organisms, based on the assumptions that the filaments are composed of cells which undergo changes of state under inputs they receive from their neighbors, and the cells produce outputs as determined by their state and the input they receive. Cell division is accounted for by inserting two new cells in the filament to replace a cell of a specified state and input. Thus growing filaments are obtained which exhibit various developmental patterns, like constant apical pattern, non-dividing apical zone, and banded patterns. In this first part of this study the inputs are considered to pass only in one direction along the filament. Formal set-theoretical statement of the assumptions, and of some of the theorems derivable from them, is included. {\textcopyright}1968.},

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

abstract = {Despite renewed interest in emergent language simulations with neural networks, little is known about the basic properties of the induced code, and how they compare to human language. One fundamental characteristic of the latter, known as Zipf's Law of Abbreviation (ZLA), is that more frequent words are efficiently associated to shorter strings. We study whether the same pattern emerges when two neural networks, a “speaker” and a “listener”, are trained to play a signaling game. Surprisingly, we find that networks develop an anti-efficient encoding scheme, in which the most frequent inputs are associated to the longest messages, and messages in general are skewed towards the maximum length threshold. This anti-efficient code appears easier to discriminate for the listener, and, unlike in human communication, the speaker does not impose a contrasting least-effort pressure towards brevity. Indeed, when the cost function includes a penalty for longer messages, the resulting message distribution starts respecting ZLA. Our analysis stresses the importance of studying the basic features of emergent communication in a highly controlled setup, to ensure the latter will not depart too far from human language. Moreover, we present a concrete illustration of how different functional pressures can lead to successful communication codes that lack basic properties of human language, thus highlighting the role such pressures play in the latter.},

@article{Crombach2008a,
abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are perhaps the most important organizational level in the cell where signals from the cell state and the outside environment are integrated in terms of activation and inhibition of genes. For the last decade, the study of such networks has been fueled by large-scale experiments and renewed attention from the theoretical field. Different models have been proposed to, for instance, investigate expression dynamics, explain the network topology we observe in bacteria and yeast, and for the analysis of evolvability and robustness of such networks. Yet how these gene regulatory networks evolve and become evolvable remains an open question. An individual-oriented evolutionary model is used to shed light on this matter. Each individual has a genome from which its gene regulatory network is derived. Mutations, such as gene duplications and deletions, alter the genome, while the resulting network determines the gene expression pattern and hence fitness. With this protocol we let a population of individuals evolve under Darwinian selection in an environment that changes through time. Our work demonstrates that long-term evolution of complex gene regulatory networks in a changing environment can lead to a striking increase in the efficiency of generating beneficial mutations. We show that the population evolves towards genotype-phenotype mappings that allow for an orchestrated network-wide change in the gene expression pattern, requiring only a few specific gene indels. The genes involved are hubs of the networks, or directly influencing the hubs. Moreover, throughout the evolutionary trajectory the networks maintain their mutational robustness. In other words, evolution in an alternating environment leads to a network that is sensitive to a small class of beneficial mutations, while the majority of mutations remain neutral: an example of evolution of evolvability. {\textcopyright}2008 Crombach, Hogeweg.},

In this paper, we introduce periodic team synchronization domains, as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with limited communication, but they can periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. We present a team agent structure that allows for an agent to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change formations dynamically, according to pre-defined triggers to be evaluated at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall team. Our team structure further includes pre-planning for frequent situations. We fully implemented this approach in the domain of robotic soccer. Our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition, in which 29 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 67-9 over six different games, and successfully demonstrated its flexible team structure. Using the same team structure, our small robot team won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition, in which 4 teams participated.

If the meaning of the words machine' and' think are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, Can machines think is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the imitation game '. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either X is A and Y is B or X is B and Y is A'. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: C : Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer.

In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as I am the woman, don't listen to him t to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make mmilar remarks. We now ask the question, What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman These questions replace our original,' Can machines think},

It is possible that a collaborative process combining feedback from multiple users can improve the quality and quantity of generated artifacts. Picbreeder, a large-scale online experiment in collaborative interactive evolution (CIE), explores this potential. Picbreeder is an online community in which users can evolve and share images, and most importantly, continue evolving others' images. Through this process of branching from other images, and through continually increasing image complexity made possible by the underlying neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm, evolved images proliferate unlike in any other current IEC system. This paper discusses not only the strengths of the Picbreeder approach, but its challenges and shortcomings as well, in the hope that lessons learned will inform the design of future CIE systems.},

abstract = {Virtual creatures operating in a physically realistic 3D environment, as originally introduced by Karl Sims, provide a challenging domain for artificial evolution. However, few coevolutionary experiments have been reported. Here we describe the results of our experiments on the evolution of physical combat among virtual creatures: essentially, we evolve creatures that trade blows with each other. While several authors have involved highly abstract forms of `combat' in their systems, this is (to our knowledge) the first example of realistic physical combat between virtual creatures, based on actual contact and physical damage. This poses the question of apportioning damage in a collision. Our solution is to assign damage proportionally to how much each colliding limb contributed to the occurrence and depth of the collision. Our system successfully evolves a wide range of morphologies and fighting behaviours, which we describe visually and verbally. As with our previous efforts, our source code is publicly available.},

abstract = {Genetic spaces are often described in terms of fitness landscapes or genotype-to- phenotype maps, where each potential genetic sequence is associated with a set of properties and connected to other genotypes that are a single mutation away. The positions close to a genotype make up its mutational landscape and, in aggregate, determine the short-term evolutionary potential of a population. Populations with wider ranges of phenotypes in their mutational neighborhood tend to be more evolvable. Likewise, those with fewer phenotypic changes available in their local neighborhoods are more mutationally robust. As such, forces that alter the distribution of phenotypes available by mutation can have a profound effect on subsequent evolutionary dynamics. We demonstrate that cyclically-changing environments can push populations toward more evolvable mutational landscapes where a wide range of alternate phenotypes are available, though purely deleterious mutations remain suppressed. We further show that populations in environments with drastic changes shift phenotypes more readily than those in environments with more benign changes. We trace this effect to repeated population bottlenecks in the harsh environments, which result in shorter coalescence times and keep populations in regions of the mutational landscape where the phenotypic shifts in question are more likely to occur.},

abstract = {The theory of evolution links random variation and selection to incremental adaptation. In a different intellectual domain, learning theory links incremental adaptation (e.g., from positive and/or negative reinforcement) to intelligent behaviour. Specifically, learning theory explains how incremental adaptation can acquire knowledge from past experience and use it to direct future behaviours toward favourable outcomes. Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the 'uninformed' process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles - the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of ecological organisation, and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs.},

abstract = {Artificial gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are biologically inspired dynamical systems used to control various kinds of agents, from the cells in developmental models to embodied robot swarms. Most recent work uses a genetic algorithm (GA) or an evolution strategy in order to optimize the network for a specific task. However, the empirical performances of these algorithms are unsatisfactory. This paper presents an algorithm that primarily exploits a network distance metric, which allows genetic similarity to be used for speciation and variation of GRNs. This algorithm, inspired by the successful neuroevolution of augmenting topologies algorithm's use in evolving neural networks and compositional pattern-producing networks, is based on a specific initialization method, a crossover operator based on gene alignment, and speciation based upon GRN structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new algorithm by comparing our approach both to a standard GA and to evolutionary programming on four different experiments from three distinct problem domains, where the proposed algorithm excels on all experiments.},

abstract = {Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS) is a rare, low-grade soft tissue neoplasm preferentially arising in the extremities of young to middle-aged adults characterized histologically by a variegated appearance and absence of a distinctive immunophenotype. Herein we have evaluated a series of 73 cases of MIFS to define potential features and markers that may facilitate diagnosis. An immunohistochemical study with a large panel of antibodies showed strong positivity of the tumor cells for bcl-1 (94.5{\%}), FXIIIa (89{\%}), CD10 (80{\%}), and D2–40 (56{\%}). FISH and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) were performed in a large subset of cases to investigate the utility for detecting the TGFBR3 and OGA t(1;10) rearrangement and BRAF abnormalities. Using a combination of FISH and/or aCGH, t(1;10) was detected in only 3 of 54 cases (5.5{\%}). The aCGH study also demonstrated amplification of VGLL3 on chromosome 3 that was detected in 8 of 20 cases (40{\%}). BRAF alterations were observed by FISH in 4 of 70 cases (5.7{\%}) and correlated with gain of chromosome 3p12 (VGLL3). A novel fusion transcript involving exon 6 of ZNF335 and exon 10 of BRAF was identified in one case. Demonstration of amplification of VGLL3 on chromosome 3 in combination with expression of bcl-1 and FXIIIa may help support the diagnosis, however, due to their low specificity these markers are not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis in the absence of the appropriate clinical-pathological context. Until a more robust genetic or immunohistochemical signature is identified, the diagnosis of MIFS rests on its characteristic clinicopathological features.},

In this article, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, that is, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel bio-inspired predictive model of visual navigation inspired by mammalian navigation. This model takes inspiration from specific types of neurons observed in the brain, namely place cells, grid cells and head direction cells. In the proposed model, place cells are structures that store and connect local representations of the explored environment, grid and head direction cells make predictions based on these representations to define the position of the agent in a place cell's reference frame. This specific use of navigation cells has three advantages: First, the environment representations are stored by place cells and require only a few spatialized descriptors or elements, making this model suitable for the integration of large-scale environments (indoor and outdoor). Second, the grid cell modules act as an efficient visual and absolute odometry system. Finally, the model provides sequential spatial tracking that can integrate and track an agent in redundant environments or environments with very few or no distinctive cues, while being very robust to environmental changes. This paper focuses on the architecture formalization and the main elements and properties of this model. The model has been successfully validated on basic functions: mapping, guidance, homing, and finding shortcuts. The precision of the estimated position of the agent and the robustness to environmental changes during navigation were shown to be satisfactory. The proposed predictive model is intended to be used on autonomous platforms, but also to assist visually impaired people in their mobility.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are constructed frequently in biological research to provide an understanding of the evolutionary history of the organisms being studied. Often, the actual phylogenetic tree is unknown and the phylogenetic tree constructed is an estimate. There are many methods of phylogenetic tree construction which fall into two main categories: distance-based methods and character-based methods. To test the accuracy of these methods, it is necessary that the system being studied is one for which the actual phylogenetic tree is known. EcoSim is an ecosystem simulation in which predator and prey agents possessing a complex behavioral model can interact, evolve and speciate. In this experiment, we used EcoSim to test the accuracy of the three main distance-based phylogenetic tree construction methods, when constructing a single tree and when performing phylogenetic bootstrapping. Since EcoSim provides data regarding speciation events, we were able to construct the actual phylogenetic trees from this data. We then performed the UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, and Fitch-Margoliash methods at various time-steps and used symmetric distance as a metric to compare the topologies of the actual and estimated trees. On average, trees contained nearly 30 taxa. We found that the Fitch-Margoliash method with bootstrapping performed slightly better than the other methods, however no method constructed trees in which more than 50{\%} of the partitions were correct. {\textcopyright}2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

While many encoding schemes exist to facilitate this translation, there are few benchmarks for neural networks that inherently utilize a temporal controller. In this work, we consider the common reinforcement problem of animat locomo-tion in an environment suited for evaluating SNNs. Using this problem, we explore novel methods of reward distribution as they impacts learning. Hebbian learning, in the form of spike time dependent plasticity (STDP), is modulated by a dopamine signal and affected by reward-induced neural activity. Different reward strategies are parameterized and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is used to find the best strategies for fixed animat morphologies. The contribution of this work is twofold: to cast the problem of animat locomotion in a form directly applicable to simple temporal controllers, and to demonstrate novel methods for reward modulated Hebbian learning.},

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is considered one of the most influential algorithms in the field. Eighteen years after its invention, a plethora of methods have been proposed that extend NEAT in different aspects. In this article, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) to list and categorize the methods succeeding NEAT. Our review protocol identified 232 papers by merging the findings of two major electronic databases. Applying criteria that determine the paper's relevance and assess its quality, resulted in 61 methods that are presented in this article. Our review article proposes a new categorization scheme of NEAT's successors into three clusters. NEAT-based methods are categorized based on 1) whether they consider issues specific to the search space or the fitness landscape, 2) whether they combine principles from NE and another domain, or 3) the particular properties of the evolved ANNs. The clustering supports researchers 1) understanding the current state of the art that will enable them, 2) exploring new research directions or 3) benchmarking their proposed method to the state of the art, if they are interested in comparing, and 4) positioning themselves in the domain or 5) selecting a method that is most appropriate for their problem.},

abstract = {Because of the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1943 The University of Chicago Press.},

This class of learning problems is difficult because of the often large combined action and observation spaces. In the fully centralized and decentralized approaches, we find the problem of spurious rewards and a phenomenon we call the "lazy agent" problem, which arises due to partial observability. We address these problems by training individual agents with a novel value-decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions.},

@article{Gruel2021,
abstract = {Visual attention can be defined as the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively focusing on a discrete aspect of sensory cues while disregarding other perceivable information. This biological mechanism, more specifically saliency detection, has long been used in multimedia indexing to drive the analysis only on relevant parts of images or videos for further processing. The recent advent of silicon retinas (or event cameras -- sensors that measure pixel-wise changes in brightness and output asynchronous events accordingly) raises the question of how to adapt attention and saliency to the unconventional type of such sensors' output. Silicon retina aims to reproduce the biological retina behaviour. In that respect, they produce punctual events in time that can be construed as neural spikes and interpreted as such by a neural network. In particular, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent an asynchronous type of artificial neural network closer to biology than traditional artificial networks, mainly because they seek to mimic the dynamics of neural membrane and action potentials over time. SNNs receive and process information in the form of spike trains. Therefore, they make for a suitable candidate for the efficient processing and classification of incoming event patterns measured by silicon retinas. In this paper, we review the biological background behind the attentional mechanism, and introduce a case study of event videos classification with SNNs, using a biology-grounded low-level computational attention mechanism, with interesting preliminary results.},

@article{Singh2012,
abstract = {Species is a Latin word meaning `kind'. In biology, species is a basic unit of biological classifica- tion and a taxonomic rank. Traditionally, species has been considered as a basic category of biological classification and defined as a group of similar organisms showing the same essence which is based on typological species concept (essentialism). Later on, in the eighteenth century, the typological species definition was found inappropriate for biological species so mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century an entirely new species concept (biological species concept) was developed which was elaborated in detail by Mayr and Dobzhansky in the twentieth century. Biological species concept is the most widely accepted species concept. There are a large number of species concepts proposed from time to time by various naturalists, taxonomists and evolutionists which define species in different manner. There are various models to explain the modes of speci- ation basically based on geographic component such as sympatric, allopatric (dichopatric and peripatric) and parapatric. Further, chromosomal models have also been suggested to explain the modes of speciation.},

abstract = {Exploding growth in computational systems forces us to gradually replace rigid design and control with decentralization and autonomy. Information technolo- gies will progress, instead, by “meta-designing” mechanisms of system self-assembly, self-regulation and evolution. Nature offers a great variety of efficient complex sys- tems, in which numerous small elements form large-scale, adaptive patterns. The new engineering challenge is to recreate this self-organization and let it freely generate in- novative designs under guidance. This article presents an original model of artificial system growth inspired by embryogenesis. A virtual organism is a lattice of cells that proliferate, migrate and self-pattern into differentiated domains. Each cell's fate is controlled by an internal gene regulatory network. Embryomorphic engineering empha- sizes hyperdistributed architectures, and their development as a prerequisite of evolu- tionary design.},

@article{Bubeck2023,
abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

abstract = {Research in neuroevolution—that is, evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs) through evolutionary algorithms—is inspired by the evolution of biological brains, which can contain trillions of connections. Yet while neuroevolution has produced successful results, the scale of natural brains remains far beyond reach. This article presents a method called hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encoding called connective compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) that can produce connectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within a hypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space. This approach can exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, thereby shifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to the underlying problem structure. Furthermore, connective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to new numbers of inputs and outputs without further evolution. HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual discrimination and food-gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing over eight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivity patterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution.},

A visualization system capable of extracting the history of speciation from low-level trace data and creating a phylogenetic tree has been implemented.

The phylogenetic trees are a more objective visualization of speciation, and enable automated collection and summarization of the results of experiments. The visualization system is used to create a phylogenetic tree from an experiment that models sympatric speciation.},

abstract = {Natural groups of animals, such as swarms of social insects, exhibit astonishing degrees of task specialization, useful to address complex tasks and to survive. This is supported by phenotypic plasticity: individuals sharing the same genotype that is expressed differently for different classes of individuals, each specializing in one task. In this work, we evolve a swarm of simulated robots with phenotypic plasticity to study the emergence of specialized collective behavior during an emergent perception task. Phenotypic plasticity is realized in the form of heterogeneity of behavior by dividing the genotype into two components, with one different neural network controller associated to each component. The whole genotype, expressing the behavior of the whole group through the two components, is subject to evolution with a single fitness function. We analyse the obtained behaviors and use the insights provided by these results to design an online regulatory mechanism. Our experiments show three main findings: 1) The sub-groups evolve distinct emergent behaviors. 2) The effectiveness of the whole swarm depends on the interaction between the two sub-groups, leading to a more robust performance than with singular sub-group behavior. 3) The online regulatory mechanism enhances overall performance and scalability.},

@article{Clune2011,
abstract = {This paper investigates how an evolutionary algorithm with an indirect encoding exploits the property of phenotypic regularity, an important design principle found in natural organisms and engineered designs. We present the first comprehensive study showing that such phenotypic regularity enables an indirect encoding to outperform direct encoding controls as problem regularity increases. Such an ability to produce regular solutions that can exploit the regularity of problems is an important prerequisite if evolutionary algorithms are to scale to high-dimensional real-world problems, which typically contain many regularities, both known and unrecognized. The indirect encoding in this case study is HyperNEAT, which evolves artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a manner inspired by concepts from biological development. We demonstrate that, in contrast to two direct encoding controls, HyperNEAT produces both regular behaviors and regular ANNs, which enables HyperNEAT to significantly outperform the direct encodings as regularity increases in three problem domains. We also show that the types of regularities HyperNEAT produces can be biased, allowing domain knowledge and preferences to be injected into the search. Finally, we examine the downside of a bias toward regularity. Even when a solution is mainly regular, some irregularity may be needed to perfect its functionality. This insight is illustrated by a new algorithm called HybrID that hybridizes indirect and direct encodings, which matched HyperNEAT's performance on regular problems yet outperformed it on problems with some irregularity. HybrID's ability to improve upon the performance of HyperNEAT raises the question of whether indirect encodings may ultimately excel not as stand-alone algorithms, but by being hybridized with a further process of refinement, wherein the indirect encoding produces patterns that exploit problem regularity and the refining process modifies that pattern to capture irregularities. This paper thus paints a more complete picture of indirect encodings than prior studies because it analyzes the impact of the continuum between irregularity and regularity on the performance of such encodings, and ultimately suggests a path forward that combines indirect encodings with a separate process of refinement.},

The model is expressed in terms of modules that represent plant organs. An organ may correspond to one or more elementary sources or sinks for carbohydrates. The whole plant is modelled as a branching network of these sources and sinks, connected by conductive elements. An analogy to an electric network is used to calculate the flow and partitioning of carbohydrates between the individual components. It can simulate multiple years of tree growth while capturing the effects of irrigation, crop load and pruning on carbon partitioning and the dynamics of architectural development. The growing tree can be visualized in a schematic or semi-realistic manner, while quantitative data characterizing individual organs, organ types or the whole tree can be output for visualization and analysis to an external program, such as MATLAB.},

To address this problem through the field of Artificial Life, we devised a polyvalent sexual reproduction scheme and an automated phylogenetic tool capable of producing, from a stream of genomes, hierarchical species trees with relatively low memory footprint. We assert that these apparatus perform well under reasonable stress by embedding them into 2D simulations of unsupervised plant evolution in textbook cases of geographical speciation. After thousands of generations and millions of plants, the extracted phylogenetic data not only showed the expected results in terms of branching pattern (anagenesis, cladogenesis) but also exhibited complex interactions between species both in space and time.},

Here we show how a standard clustering algorithm applied to the artificial genomes of such agents can be used to discover and characterize these sub-populations. As gene changes propagate throughout the pop-ulation, new subpopulations are produced, which show up as new clusters. Cluster centroids allow us to characterize these different subpopulations and identify their distinct adaptation mechanisms. We suggest these subpopulations may reason-ably be thought of as species, even if the simulation soft-ware allows interbreeding between members of the different subpopulations, and provide evidence of both sympatric and allopatric speciation in the Polyworld artificial life system. Analyzing intra-and inter-cluster fecundity differences and offspring production rates suggests that speciation is being promoted by a combination of post-zygotic selection (lower fitness of hybrid offspring) and pre-zygotic selection (assor-tative mating), which may be fostered by reinforcement (the Wallace effect).},

abstract = {A challenging goal of generative and developmental systems (GDS) is to effectively evolve neural networks as complex and capable as those found in nature. Two key properties of neural structures in nature are regularity and modularity. While HyperNEAT has proven capable of generating neural network connectivity patterns with regularities, its ability to evolve modularity remains in question. This paper investigates how altering the traditional approach to determining whether connections are expressed in HyperNEAT influences modularity. In particular, an extension is introduced called a Link Expression Output (HyperNEAT-LEO) that allows HyperNEAT to evolve the pattern of weights independently from the pattern of connection expression. Because HyperNEAT evolves such patterns as functions of geometry, important general topographic principles for organizing connectivity can be seeded into the initial population. For example, a key topographic concept in nature that encourages modularity is locality, that is, components of a module are located near each other. As experiments in this paper show, by seeding HyperNEAT with a bias towards local connectivity implemented through the LEO, modular structures arise naturally. Thus this paper provides an important clue to how an indirect encoding of network structure can be encouraged to evolve modularity. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

@misc{Stanley2003a,
abstract = {A major challenge for evolutionary computation is to evolve phenotypes such as neural networks, sensory systems, or motor controllers at the same level of complexity as found in biological organisms. In order to meet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to efficiently evolve complex phenotypes.},

@article{Islam2018,
abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

abstract = {This paper reports preliminary research work on applying developmental learning to social robotics for making human-robot interactions more instinctive and more natural. Developmental learning is an unsupervised learning strategy relying on the fact that the learning agent is intrinsically motivated, and is able to incrementally build its own representation of the world through its experiences of interaction with it. Our claim is that using developmental learning in social robots could dramatically change the way we envision human-robot interaction, notably by giving the robot an active role in the interaction building process, and even more importantly, in the way it autonomously learns suitable behaviors over time. Developmental learning appears to be an appropriate approach to develop a form of "interactional intelligence" for social robots. In this work, our goal was to set up a common framework for implementing, experimenting and evaluating developmental learning algorithms with various social robots.},

To this end, this article proposes a cell-based model that uses a “bottom-up” agent-based model coupled with ordinary differential equations, and develops the abstraction of intracellular dynamics as a basis underlying cooperative artificial network formation. Results show the emergence of self-sustainable behaviors thanks to the proposed model of metabolism that permits bacteria to grow, reproduce, interact, and coordinate at the population level to exhibit near-perfect bioluminescence behaviors. Moreover, the evolution of cooperation in the subsequent artificial network leads to the emergence of non-predicted coercive strategies. Coercion has been shown to be beneficial to share common interests between variants of cooperators leading the entire population of cells to be networked.},

But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

abstract = {The large spectrum of hearing sensitivity observed in primates results from the impact of environmental and behavioral pressures to optimize sound perception and localization. Although evidence of positive selection in auditory genes has been detected in mammals including in Hominoids, selection has never been investigated in other primates. We analyzed 123 genes highly expressed in the inner ear of 27 primate species and tested to what extent positive selection may have shaped these genes in the order Primates tree. We combined both site and branch-site tests to obtain a comprehensive picture of the positively selected genes (PSGs) involved in hearing sensitivity, and drew a detailed description of the most affected branches in the tree. We chose a conservative approach, and thus focused on confounding factors potentially affecting PSG signals (alignment, GC-biased gene conversion, duplications, heterogeneous sequencing qualities). Using site tests, we showed that around 12{\%} of these genes are PSGs, an $\alpha$ selection value consistent with average human genome estimates (10–15{\%}). Using branch-site tests, we showed that the primate tree is heterogeneously affected by positive selection, with the black snub-nosed monkey, the bushbaby, and the orangutan, being the most impacted branches. A large proportion of these genes is inclined to shape hair cells and stereocilia, which are involved in the mechanotransduction process, known to influence frequency perception. Adaptive selection, and more specifically recurrent adaptive evolution, could have acted in parallel on a set of genes (ADGRV1, USH2A, PCDH15, PTPRQ, and ATP8A2) involved in stereocilia growth and the whole complex of bundle links connecting them, in species across different habitats, including high altitude and nocturnal environments.},

abstract = {This article describes the state and the development of an artificial cell project. We discuss the experimental constraints to synthesize the most elementary cell-sized compartment that can self-reproduce using synthetic genetic information. The original idea was to program a phospholipid vesicle with DNA. Based on this idea, it was shown that in vitro gene expression could be carried out inside cell-sized synthetic vesicles. It was also shown that a couple of genes could be expressed for a few days inside the vesicles once the exchanges of nutrients with the outside environment were adequately introduced. The development of a cell-free transcription/translation toolbox allows the expression of a large number of genes with multiple transcription factors. As a result, the development of a synthetic DNA program is becoming one of the main hurdles. We discuss the various possibilities to enrich and to replicate this program. Defining a program for self-reproduction remains a difficult question as nongenetic processes, such as molecular self-organization, play an essential and complementary role. The synthesis of a stable compartment with an active interface, one of the critical bottlenecks in the synthesis of artificial cell, depends on the properties of phospholipid membranes. The problem of a self-replicating artificial cell is a long-lasting goal that might imply evolution experiments.},

We describe an automatic spoken dialogue manager for LISSA, an on-screen virtual agent that can keep older users involved in conversations over several sessions, each lasting 10-20 minutes. The idea behind LISSA is to improve users' communication skills by providing feedback on their non-verbal behavior at certain points in the course of the conversations. In this paper, we analyze the dialogues collected from the first session between LISSA and each of 8 participants. We examine the quality of the conversations by comparing the transcripts with those collected in a WOZ setting. LISSA's contributions to the conversations were judged by research assistants who rated the extent to which the contributions were "natural", "on track", "encouraging", "understanding", "relevant", and "polite". The results show that the automatic dialogue manager was able to handle conversation with the users smoothly and naturally.},

abstract = {In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general, domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.},

abstract = {This review article focuses on studying problems of observability and controllability of cellular automata (CAs) considered in the context of control theory, an important feature of which is the adoption of a state-space model. Our work first consists in generalizing the obtained results to systems described by CAs considered as the discrete counterpart of partial differential equations, and in exploring possible approaches to prove controllability and observability. After having introduced the notion of control and observation in cellular automata models, in a similar way to the case of discrete-time distributed parameter systems, we investigate these key concepts of control theory in the case of complex systems. For the controllability issue, the Boolean class is particularly studied and applied to the regional case, while the observability is approached in the general case and related to the reconstructibility problem for linear or nonlinear CAs.},

abstract = {The paper describes a new type of evolving connectionist systems (ECOS) called evolving spatio-temporal data machines based on neuromorphic, brain-like information processing principles (eSTDM). These are multi-modular computer systems designed to deal with large and fast spatio/spectro temporal data using spiking neural networks (SNN) as major processing modules. ECOS and eSTDM in particular can learn incrementally from data streams, can include 'on the fly' new input variables, new output class labels or regression outputs, can continuously adapt their structure and functionality, can be visualised and interpreted for new knowledge discovery and for a better understanding of the data and the processes that generated it. eSTDM can be used for early event prediction due to the ability of the SNN to spike early, before whole input vectors (they were trained on) are presented. A framework for building eSTDM called NeuCube along with a design methodology for building eSTDM using this is presented. The implementation of this framework in MATLAB, Java, and PyNN (Python) is presented. The latter facilitates the use of neuromorphic hardware platforms to run the eSTDM. Selected examples are given of eSTDM for pattern recognition and early event prediction on EEG data, fMRI data, multisensory seismic data, ecological data, climate data, audio-visual data. Future directions are discussed, including extension of the NeuCube framework for building neurogenetic eSTDM and also new applications of eSTDM.},

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents are trained through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. This leads to a long training time for dense neural networks to achieve good performance. Hence, prohibitive computation and memory resources are consumed. Recently, learning efficient DRL agents has received increasing attention. Yet, current methods focus on accelerating inference time. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a dynamic sparse training approach for deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the training process. The proposed approach trains a sparse neural network from scratch and dynamically adapts its topology to the changing data distribution during training. Experiments on continuous control tasks show that our dynamic sparse agents achieve higher performance than the equivalent dense methods, reduce the parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50{\%}, and have a faster learning speed that enables reaching the performance of dense agents with 40 − 50{\%} reduction in the training steps.},

@article{Lehman2008,
abstract = {This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solv- ing highly ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the dynamics of open-ended evolution in artificial life. A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actu- ally prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a sim- ple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to cap- ture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based prob- lem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behav- iors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by de- coupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly out- performs objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.},

Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.},

@article{Golestani2012,
abstract = {The origin of species remains one of the most controversial and least understood topics in evolution. While it is being widely accepted that complete cessation of gene-flow between populations owing to long-lasting geographical barriers results in a steady, irreversible increase of divergence and eventually speciation, the extent to which various degrees of habitat heterogeneity influences speciation rates is less well understood. Here, we investigate how small, randomly distributed physical obstacles influence the distribution of populations and species, the level of population connectivity (e.g. gene flow), as well as the mode and tempo of speciation in a virtual ecosystem composed of prey and predator species.We adapted an existing individualbased platform, EcoSim, to allow fine tuning of the gene flow's level between populations by adding various numbers of obstacles in the world. The platform implements a simple food chain consisting of primary producers, herbivores (prey) and predators. It allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioural models, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We observed a direct and continuous increase in the speed of evolution (e.g. the rate of speciation) with the increasing number of obstacles in the world. The spatial distribution of species was also more compact in the world with obstacles than in the world without obstacles. Our results suggest that environmental heterogeneity and other factors affecting demographic stochasticity can directly influence speciation and extinction rates. {\textcopyright}2012 The Royal Society.},

@article{Shao2010,
abstract = {One of the ecological theories has proposed that high species diversity can be maintained by predation, and several experimental studies showed that a few predator individuals with positive frequency-dependent behavior were able to maintain the coexistence of two prey types. However, in a natural environment, when a single predator species regulates the diversity of prey species, it is likely to be a full population of predators, not just a few individual predators. The role of a predator population in maintaining species diversity has not been carefully investigated in laboratory experiments but has been seriously questioned by computer simulations. In this paper, we introduce predation into the Tierra system and the dynamic relationship between prey and predator populations is examined. The robust appearance of the "Lotka-Volterra-like" cycle in Tierra suggests that the digital creatures may follow the same fundamental principles as their organic counterparts. Moreover, when each predator in a large predator population searches for prey in its neighboring area and performs positive frequency-dependent predation based on local prey abundance, a global pattern of coexistence of prey species emerges. This suggests that positive frequency-dependent predation may be a reasonable mechanism to maintain species diversity in nature.},

abstract = {We analyze a general model of multi-agent communication in which all agents communicate simultaneously to a message board. A genetic algorithm is used to evolve multi-agent languages for the predator agents in a version of the predator-prey pursuit problem. We show that the resulting behavior of the communicating multi-agent system is equivalent to that of a Mealy finite state machine whose states are determined by the agents' usage of the evolved language. Simulations show that the evolution of a communication language improves the performance of the predators. Increasing the language size (and thus increasing the number of possible states in the Mealy machine) improves the performance even further. Furthermore, the evolved communicating predators perform significantly better than all previous work on similar prey. We introduce a method for incrementally increasing the language size, which results in an effective coarse-to-fine search that significantly reduces the evolution time required to find a solution. We present some observations on the effects of language size, experimental setup, and prey difficulty on the evolved Mealy machines. In particular, we observe that the start state is often revisited, and incrementally increasing the language size results in smaller Mealy machines. Finally, a simple rule is derived that provides a pessimistic estimate on the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent problem.},

@article{Witkowski2016,
abstract = {Swarming behavior is common in biology, from cell colonies to insect swarms and bird flocks. However, the conditions leading to the emergence of such behavior are still subject to research. Since Reynolds' boids, many artificial models have reproduced swarming behavior, focusing on details ranging from obstacle avoidance to the introduction of fixed leaders. This paper presents a model of evolved artificial agents, able to develop swarming using only their ability to listen to each other's signals. The model simulates a population of agents looking for a vital resource they cannot directly detect, in a 3D environment. Instead of a centralized algorithm, each agent is controlled by an artificial neural network, whose weights are encoded in a genotype and adapted by an original asynchronous genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that agents progressively evolve the ability to use the information exchanged between each other via signaling to establish temporary leader-follower relations. These relations allow agents to form swarming patterns, emerging as a transient behavior that improves the agents' ability to forage for the resource. Once they have acquired the ability to swarm, the individuals are able to outperform the non-swarmers at finding the resource. The population hence reaches a neutral evolutionary space which leads to a genetic drift of the genotypes. This reductionist approach to signal-based swarming not only contributes to shed light on the minimal conditions for the evolution of a swarming behavior, but also more generally it exemplifies the effect communication can have on optimal search patterns in collective groups of individuals.},

@article{Zador2019,
abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have undergone a revolution, catalyzed by better supervised learning algorithms. However, in stark contrast to young animals (including humans), training such networks requires enormous numbers of labeled examples, leading to the belief that animals must rely instead mainly on unsupervised learning. Here we argue that most animal behavior is not the result of clever learning algorithms—supervised or unsupervised—but is encoded in the genome. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them to learn very rapidly. Because the wiring diagram is far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome, it must be compressed through a “genomic bottleneck”. The genomic bottleneck suggests a path toward ANNs capable of rapid learning.},

In order to test the generality of Quinn's result we use a similar task but a completely different agent architecture. We find that qualitatively similar behaviours emerge, but it is not clear whether they are genuinely communicative. We extend Quinn's work by adding perceptual noise and internal state to the agents in order to promote ritualization of the nascent signal. Results were inconclusive; philosophical implications are discussed.},

@article{Norouzzadeh2016,
abstract = {Many animals predict the outcomes of their actions by internal models. Such "forward models" enable animals to rapidly simulate many actions without performing them to choose an appropriate action. Robots would similarly benefit from forward models. However, such models must change over time to account for changes in the environment or body, such as injury. Thus, forward models must not only be accurate, but also adaptable. Neural networks can learn complex functions with high accuracy, hence they are suitable candidates to build forward models for robots. Generally, neural networks are static, which means once they pass the training phase, their weights remain unchanged and they thus cannot adapt themselves if something about the world or their body changes. Plastic neural networks change their connections over time via local learning rules (e.g. Hebbian rule) and can thus deal with unforeseen changes. A more complex, yet still biologically-inspired, technique is neuromodulation, which can change per-connection learning rates in different contexts. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that neuromodulation may improve the evolution of forward models because it can heighten learning after drastic changes such as injury. We compare forward models evolved with neuromodulation to those evolved with static neural networks and Hebbian plastic neural networks. The results show that neuromodulation produces forward models that can adapt to changes significantly better than the controls. Our findings suggest that neuromodulation is an effective tool for enabling robots (and artificial intelligence agents, more generally) to have more adaptable, effective forward models.},

@article{Yun2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a system of identifying individuals by their gait patterns. We take into account various distinguishable features that can be extracted from a user's gait and then divide them into two classes: walking pattern and stepping pattern. The conditions we assume are that our target environments are domestic areas, the number of users is smaller than 10, and all users ambulate with bare feet considering the everyday lifestyle of the Korean home. Under these conditions, we have developed a system that identifies individuals' gait patterns using our biometric sensor, UbiFloorII. We have created UbiFloorII to collect walking samples and created software modules to extract the user's gait pattern. To identify the users based on the gait patterns extracted from walking samples over UbiFloorII, we have deployed multilayer perceptron network, a feedforward artificial neural network model. The results show that both walking pattern and stepping pattern extracted from users' gait over the UbiFloorII are distinguishable enough to identify the users and that fusing two classifiers at the matching score level improves the recognition accuracy. Therefore, our proposed system may provide unobtrusive and automatic user identification methods in ubiquitous computing environments, particularly in domestic areas.},

@article{Baldominos2020,
abstract = {Neuroevolution is the name given to a field of computer science that applies evolutionary computation for evolving some aspects of neural networks. After the AI Winter came to an end, neural networks reemerged to solve a great variety of problems. However, their usage requires designing their topology, a decision with a potentially high impact on performance. Whereas many works have tried to suggest rules-of-thumb for designing topologies, the truth is that there are not analytic procedures for determining the optimal one for a given problem, and trial-and-error is often used instead. Neuroevolution arose almost 3 decades ago, with some works focusing on the evolutionary design of the topology and most works describing techniques for learning connection weights. Since then, evolutionary computation has been proved to be a convenient approach for determining the topology and weights of neural networks, and neuroevolution has been applied to a great variety of fields. However, for more than 2 decades neuroevolution has mainly focused on simple artificial neural networks models, far from today's deep learning standards. This is insufficient for determining good architectures for modern networks extensively used nowadays, which involve multiple hidden layers, recurrent cells, etc. More importantly, deep and convolutional neural networks have become a de facto standard in representation learning for solving many different problems, and neuroevolution has only focused in this kind of networks in very recent years, with many works being presented in 2017 onward. In this paper, we review the field of neuroevolution during the last 3 decades. We will put the focus on very recent works on the evolution of deep and convolutional neural networks, which is a new but growing field of study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best survey reviewing the literature in this field, and we have described the features of each work as well as their performance on well-known databases when available. This work aims to provide a complete reference of all works related to neuroevolution of convolutional neural networks up to the date. Finally, we will provide some future directions for the advancement of this research area.},

In this scheme, neurons are arranged in one-dimensional array, and the order informations of neurons play important roles in genetic operation. Due to one-dimensional structure, encoding from neural network architecture to genotype becomes easy, and genetic operation can be easily applied. To avoid the permutation problem, we choose evolutionary programming (EP) rather than genetic algorithm (GA), i.e., we apply mutation operators only in order to generate offspring. The proposed scheme is applied to XOR and 3-parity problems, and optimal neural network architectures can be found with this encoding scheme.},

abstract = {This paper compares the efficiency of two encoding schemes for Artificial Neu-ral Networks optimized by evolutionary algorithms. Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input.},

abstract = {This article presents studies on plants and their communities through experiments with a multi-agent platform of generic virtual plants. Based on Artificial Life concepts, the model has been designed for long-term simulations spanning a large number of generations while emphasizing the most important morphological and physiological aspects of a single plant. The virtual plants combine a physiological transport-resistance model with a morphological model using the L-system formalism and grow in a simplified 3D artificial ecosystem. Experiments at three different scales are carried out and compared to observations on real plant species. At the individual level, single virtual plants are grown in order to examine their responses to environmental constraints. A number of emerging characteristics concerning individual plant growth can be observed. Unifying field observation, mathematical theory and computer simulation, population level experiments on intraspecific and interspecific competition for resources are related to corresponding aggregate models of population dynamics. The latter provide a more general understanding of the experiments with respect to long-term trends and equilibrium conditions. Studies at the evolutionary level aim at morphogenesis and the influence of competition on plant morphology. Among other results, it is shown how the struggle for resources induces an arms race that leads to the evolution of elongated growth in contrast to rather ample forms at ground-level when the plants evolve in isolation. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright}Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a functional-structural plant model based on artificial life concepts and L-systems. This model takes into account realistic physiological rules, the architecture of the plants and their demography. An original benefit of this approach is that it allows the simulation of plant evolution at both functional and life-history levels implementing mutations to the L-systems and a set of genetic parameter values. The conducted experiments focus on the evolutionary emergence of different life history strategies in an environment with heterogeneous resource availability and disturbance frequency. It is found that, depending on the encountered conditions, the plants develop three major strategies classified as competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals according to Grime's CSR theory. Most of the evolved characteristics comply with theoretical biology or field observations on natural plants. Besides these results, our modelling framework is highly flexible and many refinements can be readily implemented depending on the issues one intends to address. Moreover, the model can readily be used to address many questions at the interface between evolutionary ecology, plant functional and community ecologies and ecosystem ecology.},

@article{Stanley2019,
abstract = {Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field's contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence.},

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

Here, we present an overview of our simulation methods and some results. Our most notable results are as follows. First, co-evolution works to produce good pursuers and good evaders through a pure bootstrapping process, but both types are rather specially adapted to their opponents' current counter-strategies. Second, eyes and brains can also co-evolve within each simulated species -- for example, pursuers usually evolved eyes on the front of their bodies (like cheetahs), while evaders usually evolved eyes pointing sideways or even backwards (like gazelles). Third, both kinds of coevolution are promoted by allowing spatially distributed populations, gene duplication, and an explicitly spatial morphogenesis program for eyes and brains that allows bilateral symmetry.

Initial efforts have confirmed the previous observation that the naive combination of these two techniques fails because the rescaling of sharing and the autoscaling of tournament selection fight one another. This paper demonstrates empirically and analytically that the dynamics of the naive combination are chaotic and result in a rapid loss of the number of niches that can be supported over time. The paper also shows that when tournament selection is used with a modified form of sharing that is continuously updated in the target population, the dynamics become stable and the resulting selection scheme is able to promote and maintain multiple subpopulations over many generations, virtually without loss. Further investigation is necessary, but this new scheme, tournament selection with continuously updated sharing, is ready for trial in those GAs where reliable niching is a must.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Recent approaches in evolutionary robotics (ER) propose to generate behavioral diversity in order to evolve desired behaviors more easily. These approaches require the definition of a behavioral distance, which often includes task-specific features and hence a priori knowledge. Alternative methods, which do not explicitly force selective pressure towards diversity (SPTD) but still generate it, are known from the field of artificial life, such as in artificial ecologies (AEs). In this study, we investigate how SPTD is generated without task-specific behavioral features or other forms of a priori knowledge and detect how methods of generating SPTD can be transferred from the domain of AE to ER. A promising finding is that in both types of systems, in systems from ER that generate behavioral diversity and also in the investigated speciation model, selective pressure is generated towards unpopulated regions of search space. In a simple case study we investigate the practical implications of these findings and point to options for transferring the idea of self-organizing SPTD in AEs to the domain of ER.},

The graph is encoded in the form of a linear string of integers. The inputs or terminal set and node outputs are numbered sequentially. The node functions are also separately numbered. The genotype is just a list of node connections and functions. The genotype is then mapped to an indexed graph that can be executed as a program. Evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve the genotype in a symbolic regression problem (sixth order polynomial) and the Santa Fe Ant Trail. The computational effort is calculated for both cases. It is suggested that hit effort is a more reliable measure of computational efficiency. A neutral search strategy that allows the fittest genotype to be replaced by another equally fit genotype (a neutral genotype) is examined and compared with non-neutral search for the Santa Fe ant problem. The neutral search proves to be much more effective.},

This work spans issues related to animal communication and the origins and evolution of language. The studies reviewed show how population size, spatial constraints on agent interactions, and the tasks involved can all influence the nature of the communication systems and the ease with which they are learned and/or evolved. Although progress in this area has been substantial, we are able to identify some important areas for future research in the evolution of language, including the need for further computational investigation of key aspects of language such as open vocabulary and the more complex aspects of syntax.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed. {\textcopyright}Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

@article{Angus2023,
abstract = {The evolutionary robotics field offers the possibility of autonomously generating robots that are adapted to desired tasks by iteratively optimising across successive generations of robots with varying configurations until a high-performing candidate is found. The prohibitive time and cost of actually building this many robots means that most evolutionary robotics work is conducted in simulation, but to apply evolved robots to real-world problems, they must be implemented in hardware, which brings new challenges. This paper explores in detail the design of an example system for realising diverse evolved robot bodies, and specifically how this interacts with the evolutionary process. We discover that every aspect of the hardware implementation introduces constraints that change the evolutionary space, and exploring this interplay between hardware constraints and evolution is the key contribution of this paper. In simulation, any robot that can be defined by a suitable genetic representation can be implemented and evaluated, but in hardware, real-world limitations like manufacturing/assembly constraints and electrical power delivery mean that many of these robots cannot be built, or will malfunction in operation. This presents the novel challenge of how to constrain an evolutionary process within the space of evolvable phenotypes to only those regions that are practically feasible: the viable phenotype space. Methods of phenotype filtering and repair were introduced to address this, and found to degrade the diversity of the robot population and impede traversal of the exploration space. Furthermore, the degrees of freedom permitted by the hardware constraints were found to be poorly matched to the types of morphological variation that would be the most useful in the target environment. Consequently, the ability of the evolutionary process to generate robots with effective adaptations was greatly reduced. The conclusions from this are twofold. 1) Designing a hardware platform for evolving robots requires different thinking, in which all design decisions should be made with reference to their impact on the viable phenotype space. 2) It is insufficient to just evolve robots in simulation without detailed consideration of how they will be implemented in hardware, because the hardware constraints have a profound impact on the evolutionary space.},

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

abstract = {A promising approach for teaching artificial agents to use natural language involves using human-in-the-loop training. However, recent work suggests that current machine learning methods are too data inefficient to be trained in this way from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two categories of learning signals with the ultimate goal of improving sample efficiency: imitating human language data via supervised learning, and maximizing reward in a simulated multi-agent environment via self-play (as done in emergent communication), and introduce the term supervised self-play (S2P) for algorithms using both of these signals. We find that first training agents via supervised learning on human data followed by self-play outperforms the converse, suggesting that it is not beneficial to emerge languages from scratch. We then empirically investigate various S2P schedules that begin with supervised learning in two environments: a Lewis signaling game with symbolic inputs, and an image-based referential game with natural language descriptions. Lastly, we introduce population based approaches to S2P, which further improves the performance over single-agent methods.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biodiversity has become an important line of research in theoretical ecology and, in particular, conservation biology. However, studying the evolution of ecological communities under traditional modeling approaches based on differential calculus requires species' characteristics to be predefined, which limits the generality of the results. An alternative but less standardized methodology relies on intensive computer simulation of evolving communities made of simple, explicitly described individuals. We study here the formation, evolution, and diversity dynamics of a community of virtual plants with a novel individual-centered model involving three different scales: the genetic, the developmental, and the physiological scales. It constitutes an original attempt at combining development, evolution, and population dynamics (based on multi-agent interactions) into one comprehensive, yet simple model. In this world, we observe that our simulated plants evolve increasingly elaborate canopies, which are capable of intercepting ever greater amounts of light. Generated morphologies vary from the simplest one-branch structure of promoter plants to a complex arborization of several hundred thousand branches in highly evolved variants. On the population scale, the heterogeneous spatial structuration of the plant community at each generation depends solely on the evolution of its component plants. Using this virtual data, the morphologies and the dynamics of diversity production were analyzed by various statistical methods, based on genotypic and phenotypic distance metrics. The results demonstrate that diversity can spontaneously emerge in a community of mutually interacting individuals under the influence of specific environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Proposes a TD (temporal difference) and GA (genetic algorithm) based reinforcement (TDGAR) neural learning scheme for controlling chaotic dynamical systems based on the technique of small perturbations. The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to fulfil the reinforcement learning task. Structurally, the TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network for helping the learning of the other network, the action network, which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system. Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since an external reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions have occurred in the reinforcement learning problems. By defining a simple external reinforcement signal. the TDGAR learning system can learn to produce a series of small perturbations to convert chaotic oscillations of a chaotic system into desired regular ones with a periodic behavior. The proposed method is an adaptive search for the optimum control technique. Computer simulations on controlling two chaotic systems, i.e., the Henon map and the logistic map, have been conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {A long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory has been whether it can explain the origin of complex organismal features. We examined this issue using digital organisms - computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features.

abstract = {Artificial life simulations are an important tool in the study of ecological phenomena that can be difficult to examine directly in natural environments. Recent work has established the soundscape as an ecologically important resource and it has been proposed that the differentiation of animal vocalizations within a soundscape is driven by the imperative of intraspecies communication. The experiments in this paper test that hypothesis in a simulated soundscape in order to verify the feasibility of intraspecies communication as a driver of acoustic niche differentiation. The impact of intraspecies communication is found to be a significant factor in the division of a soundscape's frequency spectrum when compared to simulations where the need to identify signals from conspecifics does not drive the evolution of signalling. The method of simulating the effects of interspecies interactions on the soundscape is positioned as a tool for developing artificial life agents that can inhabit and interact with physical ecosystems and soundscapes.},

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

The artificial evolution of such creatures potentially offers some relief from the difficult and time consuming task of specifying morphologies and behaviors. But, while artificial life techniques have been used to create a variety of virtual creatures, previous work has not scaled beyond creatures with 50 components and the most recent work has generated creatures that are unnatural looking. Here we describe a system that uses Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) as the encoding of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for creating virtual creatures. Creatures evolved by this system have hundreds of parts, and the use of an L-system as the encoding results in creatures with a more natural look. {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As a consequence, there has been increasing interest in understanding to what extent they process language as humans do. We aim here to uncover which biases such models display with respect to “natural” word-order constraints. We train models to communicate about paths in a simple gridworld, using miniature languages that reflect or violate various natural language trends, such as the tendency to avoid redundancy or to minimize long-distance dependencies. We study how the controlled characteristics of our miniature languages affect individual learning and their stability across multiple network generations. The results draw a mixed picture. On the one hand, neural networks show a strong tendency to avoid long-distance dependencies. On the other hand, there is no clear preference for the efficient, non-redundant encoding of information that is widely attested in natural language. We thus suggest inoculating a notion of “effort” into neural networks, as a possible way to make their linguistic behavior more human-like.},

It investigates trends in A-Life that have led to a predominance of simulations incorporating artificial evolution acting on generic agents, but lacking a level of detail that would allow the emergence of phenomena relating to the transfer and transformation of energy and matter between the virtual abiotic environment and biota. Implications of these characteristics for the relevance of A-Life's virtual ecosystem models to Ecology are discussed. We argue a position that the inclusion of low-level representations of energetics, matter and evolution, in concert with pattern-oriented modelling techniques from Ecology for model validation, will improve the relevance of A-Life models to Ecology. We also suggest two methods that may allows us to meet this goal: artificial evolution can be employed as a mechanism for automating pattern-oriented ecological modelling from the level of individual species up to that of the ecosystem, or it may be employed to explore general principles of ecosystem behaviour over evolutionary time periods.},

AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning fields. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {While the history of machine learning so far largely encompasses a series of problems posed by researchers and algorithms that learn their solutions, an important question is whether the problems themselves can be generated by the algorithm at the same time as they are being solved. Such a process would in effect build its own diverse and expanding curricula, and the solutions to problems at various stages would become stepping stones towards solving even more challenging problems later in the process. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper does just that: it pairs the generation of environmental challenges and the optimization of agents to solve those challenges. It simultaneously explores many different paths through the space of possible problems and solutions and, critically, allows these stepping-stone solutions to transfer between problems if better, catalyzing innovation. The term open-ended signifies the intriguing potential for algorithms like POET to continue to create novel and increasingly complex capabilities without bound. Our results show that POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization alone, or even through a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm introduced to highlight the critical role of open-endedness in solving ambitious challenges. The ability to transfer solutions from one environment to another proves essential to unlocking the full potential of the system as a whole, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of fortuitous stepping stones. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains, where algorithms like POET can blaze a trail through their interesting possible manifestations and solutions.},

abstract = {Distributed Embodied Evolution (dEE) is a powerful approach to learn behaviors in robot swarms by exploiting their intrinsic parallelism: each robot runs an evolutionary algorithm, and locally shares its learning experience with other nearby robots. Given the distributed nature of this approach, dEE entails different evolutionary dynamics when compared to standard centralized Evolutionary Robotics. In this paper, we investigate the distributed evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) as controller representation to learn swarm robot behavior, which have been extensively used for the evolution of single-robot behavior with remarkable success. Concretely, we use dEE to evolve fixed-topology GRN swarm robot controllers for an item collection task; this constitutes the first work to evolve GRNs in distributed swarm robot settings. To improve our understanding of such distributed GRN evolution, we analyze the fitness and the behavioral diversity of the swarm over generations when using 5 levels of increasing local selection pressure and 4 different swarm sizes, from 25 to 200 robots. Our experiments reveal that there exist different regimes, depending on the swarm size, in the relationship between local selection pressure, and both behavioral diversity and overall swarm performance, providing several insights on distributed evolution. We further use a metric to quantify selection pressure in evolutionary systems, which is based on the correlation between number of offspring and fitness of the behaviors. This reveals a complex relationship on the overall selection pressure between the ability or ease to spread genomes (or environmental pressure), and the fitness of the behavior (or task-oriented (local) pressure), opening new research questions. We conclude the paper by discussing the need for developing specialized statistical tools to facilitate the analysis of the large and diverse amount of data relevant to distributed Embodied Evolution.},

The development process resembles biological cell division. A genetic algorithm is used to find a grammar tree that yields both architecture and weights specifying a particular neural network for solving specific Boolean functions. The current study particularly focuses on the addition of learning to the development process and the evolution of grammar trees. Three ways of adding learning to the development process are explored. Two of these exploit the Baldwin e-ect by changing the fitness landscape without using Lamarckian evolution. The third strategy is Lamarckian in nature. Results for these three modes of combining learning with genetic search are compared against genetic search without learning. Our results suggest that merely using learning to change the fimess landscape can be as effective as Lamarckian strategies at improving search.},

@article{Yan2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physiological and architectural plant models have originally been developed for different purposes and therefore have little in common, thus making combined applications difficult. There is, however, an increasing demand for crop models that simulate the genetic and resource-dependent variability of plant geometry and architecture, because man is increasingly able to transform plant production systems through combined genetic and environmental engineering. MODEL: GREENLAB is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual-scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non-limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other 'hidden' plant parameters are calibrated using the non-linear, least-square method. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The model reproduced accurately the dynamics of plant growth, architecture and geometry of various annual and woody plants, enabling 3D visualization. It was also able to simulate the variability of leaf size on the plant and compensatory growth following pruning, as a result of internal competition for resources. The potential of the model's underlying concepts to predict the plant's phenotypic plasticity is discussed.},

abstract = {Referential communication is a”representation-hungry” behavior, and the bee waggle dance is a classical example of referential communication in nature. We used an evolutionary robotics approach to create a simulation model of a minimalist example of this situation. Two structurally identical agents engage in embodied interaction such that one of them can find a distant target in 2D space that only the other could perceive. This is a challenging task: during their interaction the agents must disambiguate translational and communicative movements, allocate distinct behavioral roles (sender versus receiver), and switch behaviors from communicative to target seeking behavior. We found an evolutionary convention with compositionality akin to the waggle dance, correlating duration and angle of interaction with distance and angle to target, respectively. We propose that this behavior is more appropriately described as interactive mindshaping, rather than as the transfer of informational content.},

@article{Stanley2003,
abstract = { A potentially powerful application of evolutionary computation (EC) is to evolve neural networks for automated control tasks. However, in such tasks environments can be unpredictable and fixed control policies may fail when conditions suddenly change. Thus, there is a need to evolve neural networks that can adapt, i.e. change their control policy dynamically as conditions change. In this paper, we examine two methods for evolving neural networks with dynamic policies. The first method evolves recurrent neural networks with fixed connection weights, relying on internal state changes to lead to changes in behavior. The second method evolves local rules that govern connection weight changes. The surprising experimental result is that the former method can be more effective than evolving networks with dynamic weights, calling into question the intuitive notion that networks with dynamic synapses are necessary for evolving solutions to adaptive tasks.},

abstract = {A common idiom in biology education states, "Eyes in the front, the animal hunts. Eyes on the side, the animal hides." In this paper, we explore one possible explanation for why predators tend to have forward-facing, high-acuity visual systems. We do so using an agent-based computational model of evolution, where predators and prey interact and adapt their behavior and morphology to one another over successive generations of evolution. In this model, we observe a coevolutionary cycle between prey swarming behavior and the predator's visual system, where the predator and prey continually adapt their visual system and behavior, respectively, over evolutionary time in reaction to one another due to the well-known "predator confusion effect." Furthermore, we provide evidence that the predator visual system is what drives this coevolutionary cycle, and suggest that the cycle could be closed if the predator evolves a hybrid visual system capable of narrow, high-acuity vision for tracking prey as well as broad, coarse vision for prey discovery. Thus, the conflicting demands imposed on a predator's visual system by the predator confusion effect could have led to the evolution of complex eyes in many predators.},

In contrast, when mating is panmictic, underdominance is quickly eliminated and the population always converges on a single genotype, as predicted by mean-field approximations. The focus of this work is to examine the sensitivity of self-organizing speciation to the assumption of purely localized interactions. We alter the interaction topology from nearest neighbor interactions to panmictic interactions in two ways: (i) by increasing the size of the contiguous mating neighborhoods and (ii) by allowing for long-distance dispersal of individuals with increasing probability. Our results show self-organized speciation to be robust to mating neighborhood sizes significantly larger than nearest neighbor interactions and to probabilities of long-distance dispersal that fall well into the range of so called "small-world" interaction topologies},

abstract = {One hallmark of natural organisms is their significant evolv-ability, i.e., their increased potential for further evolution. However, reproducing such evolvability in artificial evolution remains a challenge, which both reduces the performance of evolutionary algorithms and inhibits the study of evolv-able digital phenotypes. Although some types of selection in evolutionary computation indirectly encourage evolvability, one unexplored possibility is to directly select for evolvabil-ity. To do so, we estimate an individual's future potential for diversity by calculating the behavioral diversity of its immediate offspring, and select organisms with increased offspring variation. While the technique is computationally expensive, we hypothesized that direct selection would better encourage evolvability than indirect methods. Experiments in two evolutionary robotics domains confirm this hypothesis: in both domains, such Evolvability Search produces solutions with higher evolvability than those produced with Novelty Search or traditional objective-based search algorithms. Fur-ther experiments demonstrate that the higher evolvability produced by Evolvability Search in a training environment also generalizes, producing higher evolvability in a new test environment without further selection. Overall, Evolvabil-ity Search enables generating evolvability more easily and directly, facilitating its study and understanding, and may inspire future practical algorithms that increase evolvability without significant computational overhead.},

To facilitate the use of traditional sensors, we need to convert the output signals into streams of spikes, i.e., a series of events (+1, -1) along with their corresponding timestamps. In this paper, we propose a review of the coding algorithms from a robotics perspective and further supported by a benchmark to assess their performance. We also introduce a ROS (Robot Operating System) toolbox to encode and decode input signals coming from any type of sensor available on a robot. This initiative is meant to stimulate and facilitate robotic integration of neuromorphic AI, with the opportunity to adapt traditional off-the-shelf sensors to spiking neural nets within one of the most powerful robotic tools, ROS.},

The use of reinforcement learning in real-life applications has been limited because of the sample efficiency problem. Interactive reinforcement learning has been developed to speed up the agent's learning and facilitate to learn from ordinary people by allowing them to provide social feedback, e.g, evaluative feedback, advice or instruction. Inspired by real-life biological learning scenarios, there could be many ways to provide feedback for agent learning, such as via hardware delivered, natural interaction like facial expressions, speech or gestures. The agent can even learn from feedback via unimodal or multimodal sensory input. This paper reviews methods for interactive reinforcement learning agent to learn from human social feedback and the ways of delivering feedback. Finally, we discuss some open problems and possible future research directions.},

abstract = {The most common classification of modes of speciation begins with the spatial context in which divergence occurs: sympatric, parapatric or allopatric. This classification is unsatisfactory because it divides a continuum into discrete categories, concentrating attention on the extremes, and it subordinates other dimensions on which speciation processes vary, such as the forces driving differentiation and the genetic basis ofreproductive isolation. It also ignores the fact that speciation is a prolonged process that commonly has phases in different spatial contexts. We use the example of local adaptation and partial reproductive isolation in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis to illustrate the inadequacy of the spatial classification of speciation modes. Parallel divergence in shell form in response to similar environmental gradients in England, Spain and Sweden makes this an excellent model system. However, attempts to demonstrate `incipient' and `sympatric' speciation involve speculation about the future and the past. We suggest that it is more productive to study the current balance between local adaptation and gene flow, the interaction between components of reproductive isolation and the genetic basis of differentiation.},

The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep neural networks allowed artificial agents to derive their own emergent languages that promote interaction, coordination, and collaboration within a group. Just as we humans have succeeded in creating a shared language that allows us to interact within a large group, can the emergent communication within an artificial group converge to a shared, agreed language? This research provides an analytical study of the shared emergent language within the group communication settings of different sizes and connectivities. As the group size increases up to hundreds, agents start to speak dissimilar languages, but the rate at which they successfully communicate is maintained. We observe the emergence of different dialects when we restrict group communication to have local connectivities only. Finally, we provide optimization results of group communication graphs when the number of agents one can communicate with is restricted or when we penalize communication between distant agent pairs. The optimized communication graphs show superior communication success rates compared to graphs with the same number of links, as well as the emergence of hub nodes and scale-free networks.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that trains agents to maximize cumulative rewards through interactions with environments. The integration of RL with deep learning has recently resulted in impressive achievements in a wide range of challenging tasks, including board games, arcade games, and robot control. Despite these successes, several critical challenges remain, such as brittle convergence properties caused by sensitive hyperparameters, difficulties in temporal credit assignment with long time horizons and sparse rewards, a lack of diverse exploration, particularly in continuous search space scenarios, challenges in credit assignment in multi-agent RL, and conflicting objectives for rewards. Evolutionary computation (EC), which maintains a population of learning agents, has demonstrated promising performance in addressing these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art methods for integrating EC into RL, referred to as evolutionary reinforcement learning (EvoRL). We categorize EvoRL methods according to key research areas in RL, including hyperparameter optimization, policy search, exploration, reward shaping, meta-RL, and multi-objective RL. We then discuss future research directions in terms of efficient methods, benchmarks, and scalable platforms. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the field of EvoRL, highlighting the important challenges and opportunities for future research. With the help of this survey, researchers and practitioners can develop more efficient methods and tailored benchmarks for EvoRL, further advancing this promising cross-disciplinary research field.},

abstract = {We discuss the influence upon the fields of robotics and AI of the manner one conceives the relationships between artificial agents' perception, cognition, and action. We shed some light upon a widespread paradigm we call the isolated perception paradigm that addresses perception as isolated from cognition and action. By mobilizing the resources of philosophy (phenomenology and epistemology) and cognitive sciences, and by drawing on recent approaches in AI, we explore what it could mean for robotics and AI to take distance from the isolated perception paradigm. We argue that such a renouncement opens interesting ways to explore the possibilities for designing artificial agents with intrinsic motivations and constitutive autonomy. We then propose Artificial Interactionism, our approach that escapes the isolated perception paradigm by drawing on the inversion of the interaction cycle. When the interaction cycle is inverted, input data are not percepts directly received from the environment, but outcomes of control loops. Perception is not received from sensors in isolation from cognition but is actively constructed by the cognitive architecture through interaction. We give an example implementation of artificial interactionism that demonstrates basic intrinsically motivated learning behavior in a dynamic simulated environment.},

abstract = {Modeling and rendering of natural scenes with thousands of plants poses a number of problems. The terrain must be modeled and plants must be distributed throughout it in a realistic manner, reflecting the interactions of plants with each other and with their environment. Geometric models of individual plants, consistent with their po- sitions within the ecosystem, must be synthesized to populate the scene. The scene, whichmay consist of billions of primitives, must be rendered efficiently while incorporating the subtleties of lighting in a natural environment. We have developed a system built around a pipeline of tools that address these tasks. The terrain is designed using an interactive graphical editor. Plant distribution is determined by hand (as one would dowhen designing a garden), by ecosystem simulation, or by a combination of both techniques. Given parametrized procedural models of individual plants, the geometric complexity of the scene is reduced by approximate instancing, in which similar plants, groups of plants, or plant organs are replaced by instances of representative objects before the scene is rendered. The paper includes examples of visually rich scenes synthesized using the system.},

abstract = {There has been steady progress in the field of affective computing over the last two decades that has integrated artificial intelligence techniques in the construction of computational models of emotion. Having, as a purpose, the development of a system for treating phobias that would automatically determine fear levels and adapt exposure intensity based on the user's current affective state, we propose a comparative study between various machine and deep learning techniques (four deep neural network models, a stochastic configuration network, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors), with and without feature selection, for recognizing and classifying fear levels based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral data from the DEAP (Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals) database. Fear was considered an emotion eliciting low valence, high arousal and low dominance. By dividing the ratings of valence/arousal/dominance emotion dimensions, we propose two paradigms for fear level estimation—the two-level (0—no fear and 1—fear) and the four-level (0—no fear, 1—low fear, 2—medium fear, 3—high fear) paradigms. Although all the methods provide good classification accuracies, the highest F scores have been obtained using the Random Forest Classifier—89.96{\%} and 85.33{\%} for the two-level and four-level fear evaluation modality.},

abstract = {While interest in artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been renewed by the ubiquitous use of deep learning to solve high-dimensional problems, we are still far from general artificial intelligence. In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature's brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are widespread heuristic methods inspired by natural evolution to solve difficult problems for which analytical approaches are not suitable. In many domains experimenters are not only interested in discovering optimal solutions, but also in finding the largest number of different solutions satisfying minimal requirements. However, the formulation of an effective performance measure describing these requirements, also known as fitness function, represents a major challenge. The difficulty of combining and weighting multiple problem objectives and constraints of possibly varying nature and scale into a single fitness function often leads to unsatisfactory solutions. Furthermore, selective reproduction of the fittest solutions, which is inspired by competition-based selection in nature, leads to loss of diversity within the evolving population and premature convergence of the algorithm, hindering the discovery of many different solutions. Here we present an alternative abstraction of artificial evolution, which does not require the formulation of a composite fitness function. Inspired from viability theory in dynamical systems, natural evolution and ethology, the proposed method puts emphasis on the elimination of individuals that do not meet a set of changing criteria, which are defined on the problem objectives and constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains higher diversity in the evolving population and generates more unique solutions when compared to classical competition-based evolutionary algorithms. Our findings suggest that incorporating viability principles into evolutionary algorithms can significantly improve the applicability and effectiveness of evolutionary methods to numerous complex problems of science and engineering, ranging from protein structure prediction to aircraft wing design.},

abstract = {We focus on the problem of inducing logic programs that explain models learned by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The top-down sequential covering inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithms (e.g., FOIL) apply hill-climbing search using heuristics from information theory. A major issue with this class of algorithms is getting stuck in local optima. In our new approach, however, the data-dependent hill-climbing search is replaced with a model-dependent search where a globally optimal SVM model is trained first, then the algorithm looks into support vectors as the most influential data points in the model, and induces a clause that would cover the support vector and points that are most similar to that support vector. Instead of defining a fixed hypothesis search space, our algorithm makes use of SHAP, an example-specific interpreter in explainable AI, to determine a relevant set of features. This approach yields an algorithm that captures the SVM model's underlying logic and outperforms other ILP algorithms in terms of the number of induced clauses and classification evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {We introduce the idea of Synthetic Acoustic Ecology (SAC) as a vehicle for transdisciplinary investigation to develop methods and address open theoretical, applied and aesthetic questions in scientific and artistic disciplines of acoustic ecology. Ecoacoustics is an emerging science that investigates and interprets the ecological role of sound. It draws conceptually from, and is reinvigorating the related arts-humanities disciplines historically associated with acoustic ecology, which are concerned with sonically-mediated relationships between human beings and their environments. Both study the acoustic environment, or soundscape, as the literal and conceptual site of interaction of human and non-human organisms. However, no coherent theories exist to frame the ecological role of the soundscape, or to elucidate the evolutionary processes through which it is structured. Similarly there is a lack of appropriate computational methods to analyse the macro soundscape which hampers application in conservation. We propose that a sonically situated flavour of Alife evolutionary agent-based model could build a productive bridge between the art, science and technologies of acoustic ecological investigations to the benefit of all. As a first step, two simple models of the acoustic niche hypothesis are presented which are shown to exhibit emergence of complex spectro-temporal soundscape structures and adaptation to and recovery from noise pollution events. We discuss the potential of SAC as a lingua franca between empirical and theoretical ecoacoustics, and wider transdisciplinary research in ecoacoustic ecology.},

In nature, however, creatures combining a rigid skeleton and non-rigid muscles are some of the most complex and successful examples of life on earth. Now, for the first time, creatures with fully evolved rigid-body skeletons and soft-body muscles can be developed in the virtual world, as well. By exploiting and re-purposing the capabilities of existing soft-body simulation systems, we can evolve complex and effective simulated muscles, able to drive a rigid-body skeleton. In this way, we can begin to bridge the gap between articulated and soft-bodied EVCs, and take the next step on a nature-inspired path to meaningful morphological complexity for evolved virtual creatures.},

Experiments aimed at evolving Sims-type walkers resulted in the emergence of various realistic gaits while using fairly simple objective functions. Due to the flexibility of the system, drastically different morphologies and functions evolved with only minor modifications to the system and objective function. For example, various throwing techniques evolved when selecting for catapults that propel a block as far as possible.

abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

abstract = {An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.},

The system is seeded with a linearly executed ancestor capable only of reproducing its own genome, whereas its underlying language has the capacity for multiple threads of execution (i.e., simultaneous expression of sections of the genome.) We witness the evolution to multithreaded organisms and track the development of distinct expression patterns. Additionally, we examine both the evolvability of multithreaded organisms and the level of thread differentiation as a function of environmental complexity, and find that differentiation is more pronounced in complex environments.},

abstract = {The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus' main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus' argument that computers are not in the world.},

Recent developments, however, show that algorithms are more efficient when they abandon this goal and try instead to reproduce the ability to communicate. Algorithms that do not "think" like people can affect the ability to obtain and process information in society. Referring to the concept of communication in Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems, this paper critically reconstructs the debate on the computational turn of big data as the artificial reproduction not of intelligence but of communication. Self-learning algorithms parasitically take advantage - be it consciously or unaware - of the contribution of web users to a "virtual double contingency." This provides society with information that is not part of the thoughts of anyone, but, nevertheless, enters the communication circuit and raises its complexity. The concept of communication should be reconsidered to take account of these developments, including (or not) the possibility of communicating with algorithms.},

abstract = {To build agents that can collaborate effectively with others, recent research has trained artificial agents to communicate with each other in Lewis-style referential games. However, this often leads to successful but uninterpretable communication. We argue that this is due to the game objective: communicating about a single object in a shared visual context is prone to overfitting and does not encourage language useful beyond concrete reference. In contrast, human language conveys a rich variety of abstract ideas. To promote such skills, we propose games that require communicating generalizations over sets of objects representing abstract visual concepts, optionally with separate contexts for each agent. We find that these games greatly improve systematicity and interpretability of the learned languages, according to several metrics in the literature. Finally, we propose a method for identifying logical operations embedded in the emergent languages by learning an approximate compositional reconstruction of the language.},

These environments often take the form of games; with tasks ranging from simple board games, to competitive video games.

An agent playing Obstacle Tower must learn to solve both low-level control and high-level planning problems in tandem while learning from pixels and a sparse reward signal. Unlike other benchmarks such as the Arcade Learning Environment, evaluation of agent performance in Obstacle Tower is based on an agent's ability to perform well on unseen instances of the environment. In this paper we outline the environment and provide a set of baseline results produced by current state-of-the-art Deep RL methods as well as human players.

@article{Gauci2010,
abstract = {Looking to nature as inspiration, for at least the past 25 years, researchers in the field of neuroevolution (NE) have developed evolutionary algorithms designed specifically to evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs). Yet the ANNs evolved through NE algorithms lack the distinctive characteristics of biological brains, perhaps explaining why NE is not yet a mainstream subject of neural computation. Motivated by this gap, this letter shows that when geometry is introduced to evolved ANNs through the hypercube-based neuroevolution of augmenting topologies algorithm, they begin to acquire characteristics that indeed are reminiscent of biological brains. That is, if the neurons in evolved ANNs are situated at locations in space (i.e., if they are given coordinates), then, as experiments in evolving checkers-playing ANNs in this letter show, topographic maps with symmetries and regularities can evolve spontaneously. The ability to evolve such maps is shown in this letter to provide an important advantage in generalization. In fact, the evolved maps are sufficiently informative that their analysis yields the novel insight that the geometry of the connectivity patterns of more general players is significantly smoother and more contiguous than less general ones. Thus, the results reveal a correlation between generality and smoothness in connectivity patterns. They also hint at the intriguing possibility that as NE matures as a field, its algorithms can evolve ANNs of increasing relevance to those who study neural computation in general.},

By accounting for interactions across neurons, Neuron Shapley is more effective in identifying important filters compared to common approaches based on activation patterns. Interestingly, removing just 30 filters with the highest Shapley scores effectively destroys the prediction accuracy of Inception-v3 on ImageNet. Visualization of these few critical filters provides insights into how the network functions. Neuron Shapley is a flexible framework and can be applied to identify responsible neurons in many tasks. We illustrate additional applications of identifying filters that are responsible for biased prediction in facial recognition and filters that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Removing these filters is a quick way to repair models. Computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible and therefore sampling-based approximations are used in practice. We introduce a new multi-armed bandit algorithm that is able to efficiently detect neurons with the largest Shapley value orders of magnitude faster than existing Shapley value approximation methods.},

However, their application to some realworld problems has been hampered by the lack of a training algonthm which reliably finds a nearly globally optimal set of weights in a relatively short time. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization procedures which are good at exploring a large and complex space in an intelligent way to find values close to the global optimum. Hence, they are well suited to the problem of training feedforward networks. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments performed on data from a sonar image classification problem. These experiments both 1) illustrate the improvements gained by using a genetic algorithm rather than backpropagation and 2) chronicle the evolution of the performance of the genetic algorithm as we added more and more domain-specific knowledge into it.},

Two important conclusions from the discussions are: (1) the idea of pluralism about OEE - it seems clear that there is more than one interesting and important kind of OEE; and (2) the importance of distinguishing observable behavioral hallmarks of systems undergoing OEE from hypothesized underlying mechanisms that explain why a system exhibits those hallmarks. We summarize the different hallmarks and mechanisms discussed during the workshop, and list the specific systems that were highlighted with respect to particular hallmarks and mechanisms. We conclude by identifying some of the most important open research questions about OEE that are apparent in light of the discussions.

abstract = {In moving animal groups, social interactions play a key role in the ability of individuals to achieve coordinated motion. However, a large number of environmental and cognitive factors are able to modulate the expression of these interactions and the characteristics of the collective movements that result from these interactions. Here, we use a data-driven fish school model to quantitatively investigate the impact of perceptual and cognitive factors on coordination and collective swimming patterns. The model describes the interactions involved in the coordination of burst-and-coast swimming in groups of Hemigrammus rhodostomus . We perform a comprehensive investigation of the respective impacts of two interactions strategies between fish based on the selection of the most or the two most influential neighbors, of the range and intensity of social interactions, of the intensity of individual random behavioral fluctuations, and of the group size, on the ability of groups of fish to coordinate their movements. We find that fish are able to coordinate their movements when they interact with their most or two most influential neighbors, provided that a minimal level of attraction between fish exist to maintain group cohesion. A minimal level of alignment is also required to allow the formation of schooling and milling. However, increasing the strength of social interactions does not necessarily enhance group cohesion and coordination. When attraction and alignment strengths are too high, or when the heading random fluctuations are too large, schooling and milling can no longer be maintained and the school switches to a swarming phase. Increasing the interaction range between fish has a similar impact on collective dynamics as increasing the strengths of attraction and alignment. Finally, we find that coordination and schooling occurs for a wider range of attraction and alignment strength in small group sizes.},

abstract = {Recent studies have reported that population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics, occurring at different time scales, can be affected by each other. Our purpose is to explore the interaction between population and evolutionary dynamics using an artificial life approach based on a 3D physically simulated environment in the context of predator–prey and morphology–behavior coevolution. The morphologies and behaviors of virtual prey creatures are evolved using a genetic algorithm based on the predation interactions between predators and prey. Both population sizes are also changed, depending on the fitness. We observe two types of cyclic behaviors, corresponding to short-term and long-term dynamics. The former can be interpreted as a simple population dynamics of Lotka–Volterra type. It is shown that the latter cycle is based on the interaction between the changes in the prey strategy against predators and the long-term change in both population sizes, resulting partly from a tradeoff between their defensive success and the cost of defense.},

@article{Farber1962,
abstract = {In recent years, there have been a number of engineering projects concerned with the design of brain models for pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. The basic assumption, underlying these projects is that the brain operates by built-in algorithmic methods similar to those employed in modern digital computers. Hence, nervous activity can be simulated by these computers. The value of such a program has been challenged by Lashley and others on the grounds that computer-simulated behavior is artificial, that the model is an invention operating on extrabiological principles. In this formidable book, Rosenblatt has offered a somewhat different program involving the design and testing of brain models described as perceptrons. His program is concerned not with devices for artificial intelligence, but, rather, with "the physical structures and neurodynamics principles which underly "natural intelligence." A perceptron consists of a set of signal generating units ("neuro-mimes") connected together to form a network.},

In the context of smart farming, grower combine information from sensors located close to their crops with agronomic models to help them to better understand their crops. Irrigation management is therefore based on extrapolation of data and/or agronomic model responses. This problem can be seen as a learning task for which machine learning techniques have proven their relevance in many and diverse applications. In this paper we place ourselves in the context of potato farming, a crop for which irrigation plays a crucial role. We model the problem of soil water potential prediction as a learning problem solved by supervised leaning algorithms. The problem appears to be difficult since there are several potential inputs, and several outputs to predict. Experiments are conducted on several scenarios with data acquired during 3 years. We demonstrate the possibility of applying feature selection method to automatically design models with features relevant to the problem at hand while having good performances. We have also demonstrated the relevance of the machine learning for this kind of problem, since the methods are able to correctly predict the next water potential values.},

We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain. In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences. Although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences. In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness.},

The 1990s and early 2000s saw a substantial number of publications that investigated selection pressure through methods such as takeover time and Markov chain analysis. Over the last decade, however, interest in the analysis of selection in evolutionary computing has waned. The established methods for analysis of selection pressure provide little insight when selection is based on more than comparison-of-fitness values. This can, for instance, be the case in coevolutionary systems, when measures unrelated to fitness affect the selection process (e.g., niching) or in systems that lack a crisply defined objective function. This article proposes two metrics that holistically consider the statistics of the evolutionary process to quantify selection pressure in evolutionary systems and so can be applied where traditiona...},

Speciation likewise has profound implications for artificial life, evolutionary computation, and evolutionary robotics, yet a great many aspects of it remain unexplored. Traditionally, speciation was mainly viewed as taking place allopatrically. More recently, sympatric speciation, which does not require geographic isolation, has been studied. Sympatric speciation raises a number of interesting questions with regard to how and why sym-patric populations diverge, some of which we address with a 2×2×2 factorial study that considers the factors of sexual selection, resource distribution, and population size. Our hypotheses were evaluated using a synthetic environment inspired by life on the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. In particular, the wet and dry season dynamics were modeled to produce the intense selection pressure found there. Our results provide direct evidence for the importance of both female mate choice and resource availability on speciation. They also suggest that the greater stability afforded by larger populations can lead to subpopulations between which gene flow is reduced. {\textcopyright}2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {We present an individual-based predator-prey model with, for the first time, each agent behavior being modeled by a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), allowing the evolution of the agent behavior through the epochs of the simulation. The FCM enables the agent to evaluate its environment (e.g., distance to predator or prey, distance to potential breeding partner, distance to food, energy level) and its internal states (e.g., fear, hunger, curiosity), and to choose several possible actions such as evasion, eating, or breeding. The FCM of each individual is unique and is the result of the evolutionary process. The notion of species is also implemented in such a way that species emerge from the evolving population of agents. To our knowledge, our system is the only one that allows the modeling of links between behavior patterns and speciation. The simulation produces a lot of data, including number of individuals, level of energy by individual, choice of action, age of the individuals, and average FCM associated with each species. This study investigates patterns of macroevolutionary processes, such as the emergence of species in a simulated ecosystem, and proposes a general framework for the study of specific ecological problems such as invasive species and species diversity patterns. We present promising results showing coherent behaviors of the whole simulation with the emergence of strong correlation patterns also observed in existing ecosystems. {\textcopyright}2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with different cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at different levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversity encouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

This benchmark solves three problems commonly found in other benchmarks: small maze set, all mazes belonging to the same kind of maze, and biased methods for choosing starting locations. In this benchmark, the Connectivity Based Maze Generation Algorithm is proposed for building maze sets. Mazes generated using this algorithm exhibit a property called connectivity that indicates how much the walls are connected among them. Connectivity can be used to control the diversity of the sets. Additionally, a new method for choosing starting locations, that takes into account the maze goal positions, is presented. Using the Connectivity Based Maze Generation Algorithm and the new method for choosing starting locations, two problems that test the capability of an Evolutionary Algorithm for solving mazes with similar and different connectivity are built. Example datasets are generated and experiments are performed to validate the proposed benchmark.},

However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.},

abstract = {A neural network architecture for the learning of recognition categories is derived. Real-time network dynamics are completely characterized through mathematical analysis and computer simulations. The architecture self-organizes and self-stabilizes its recognition codes in response to arbitrary orderings of arbitrarily many and arbitrarily complex binary input patterns. Top-down attentional and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. The architecture embodies a parallel search scheme which updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds. After learning self-stabilizes. the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time does not grow as a function of code complexity. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. These invariant properties emerge in the form of learned critical feature patterns, or prototypes. The architecture possesses of Mathematics, 02215 Boston University, Boston. 02215 and a context-sensitive self-scaling property which enables its emergent critical feature patterns to form. They detect and remember statistically predictive configurations of featural elements which are derived from the set of all input patterns that are ever experienced. Four types of attentional process-priming, gain control, vigilance, and intermodal competition-are mechanistically characterized. Top-down priming and gain control are needed for code matching and self-stabilization. Attentional vigilance determines how fine the learned categories will be. If vigilance increases due to an environmental disconfirmation, then the system automatically searches for and leaIlls finer recognition categories. A new nonlinear matching law (the {\~{}} Rule) and new nonlinear associative laws (the Weber Law Rule, the Associative Decay Rule, and the Template Learning Rule) are needed to achieve these properties. All the rules describe emergent properties of parallel network interactions. The architecture circumvents the noise, saturation, capacity, orthogonality, and linear predictability constraints that limit the codes which can be stably learned by alternative recognition models.},

@article{Pichler2008,
abstract = {Virtual ecosystems, where natural selection is used to evolve complex agent behavior, are often preferred to traditional genetic algorithms because the absence of an explicitly defined fitness allows for a less constrained evolutionary process. However, these model ecosystems typically pre-specify a discrete set of possible action primitives the agents can perform. We think that this also constrains the evolutionary process with the modellers preconceptions of what possible solutions could be. Therefore, we propose an ecosystem model to evolve complete agents where all higher-level behavior results strictly from the interplay between extremely simple components and where no 'behavior primitives' are defined. On the basis of four distinct survival strategies we show that such primitives are not necessary to evolve behavioral diversity even in a simple and homogeneous environment. {\textcopyright}2007 alifexi.org.},

abstract = {Presents a different type of genetic algorithm called the structured genetic algorithm (SGA) for the design of application-specific neural networks. The novelty of this new genetic approach is that it can determine the network structures and their weights solely by an evolutionary process. This is made possible for the SGA primarily due to its redundant genetic material and a gene activation mechanism which in combination provide a multi-layered structure to the chromosome. The authors focus on the use of this learning algorithm for automatic generation of a complete application specific neural network. With this approach, no a priori assumptions about topology are needed and the only information required is the input and output characteristics of the task. The empirical studies show that the SGA can efficiently determine the network size and topology along with the optimal set of connection weights appropriate for desired tasks, without using backpropagation or any other learning algorithm.},

abstract = {In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve during gameplay, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rt- NEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible a new genre of video games in which the player teaches a team of agents through a series of customized training exercises. In order to demonstrate this concept in the (NERO) game, the player trains a team of robots for combat. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and also demonstrates how multiple agents can evolve and adapt in video games like NERO in real time using rtNEAT. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications that adapt online as the user gains new skills.},

abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of clusters, or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},
